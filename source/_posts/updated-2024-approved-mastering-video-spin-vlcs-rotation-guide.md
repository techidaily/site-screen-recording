Here are the steps to perform VLC rotate video.

Step 1: Open VLC Media Player.

Step 2: Go to Media > Open File option and select the video file that you want to rotate.

If you want VLC rotate video and save feature so that the video’s rotation angle changes permanently, take the following steps on Windows.
