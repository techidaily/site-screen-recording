Another funny or rather an adorable filter to try is the cat filter. There is a multitude of cat filters available. You can check out the one that you like the most and try it out. This filter became popular after an awkward incident occurred during a virtual legal proceeding, where the advocate turned on the cat filter and appeared as a cat.
