Yes, this is a very safe app that provides more security on your screen recordings and it is available for you to download without any problem too. This does not require any unusual and unsafe permissions for running on your device.

This is an amazing app as it does everything that you want it to and more. Although this type of apps usually is hard to set up, this appears very user-friendly. The basic free version is awesome and it allows you to do anything you need to, [record screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), edit, and share say to YouTube, no problem. Another great thing about this free version is, yes, it has ads. But they are far and few in between. So no hassle or headache with them.
