#### Why Google Meet Blur Background Not Showing?

Google Meet blur background is rolling out in the market and is becoming more common and accessible with each passing day. There might be some errors or glitches, which can be resolved by restarting. However, one of the reasons that the feature of Google Meet blur is not showing accessible is because the gadget or the software is not up to date.

#### Why can't I use background blur on Google Meet?

One of the reasons why background blur on Google Meet might not be visible is because the software is not up to date or the extension is not installed. Compare the minimum Google Meet program requirement of your gadget and software (the requirements are mentioned above in the blog).
