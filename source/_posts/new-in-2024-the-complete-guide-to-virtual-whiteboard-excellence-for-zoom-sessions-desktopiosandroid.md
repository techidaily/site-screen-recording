**Zoom Whiteboard**  allows you to draw your imaginations on to the screen for visual illustrations, and share those graphics with all the participants you are in a conference with. Not only this, you can even **annotate your creations**  on the whiteboard during an ongoing meeting session, and can also allow (or disallow) other members to annotate the illustrations on your board as well.

 In addition to this, you can even allow the participants to share their **whiteboard on Zoom** if you have access to multiple monitors. This way you can view multiple whiteboard illustrations from different users simultaneously.

 Here you will learn all these and many other techniques, and by the time you are done reading, you will have a fair idea on how whiteboard works, and how to use **Zoom annotation tools**  to share your imagination with others.

## Part 3: How to Use Whiteboard During Zoom Cloud Meeting on iOS

 Along with Android, Zoom is available for iOS devices as well. However, at the time of this writing, the Whiteboard feature can only be used on iPads. So, if you’re running Zoom Cloud Meeting on your iPhone, you won’t see the Whiteboard option. Nevertheless, the interface and the options that the Zoom’s iOS variant has are almost identical, and so is the process of sharing **Zoom meeting whiteboard** .

#### 3\. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?

 If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the **Full Screen**  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the **Options**  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking **Annotate** , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.
