Although the game is available on Xbox, PC, and PlayStation as well, the Switch manages to give players a more immersive experience than those platforms. In this new generation of games, a franchise more than two decades old is brought back to its roots with updated graphics.

Although the mechanics are similar in a way, this is more like a return to a side-scrolling era, while many other titles utilize an arena matchup style of gameplay. Whether it's the intense gameplay itself or the energetic campaign, players will continue to come back to the game.

**Features:**

• Better gameplay experience as compared to other consoles

• Intense gameplay

• One of the best fighting games to play on Switch

With this exclusive title from Nintendo, you'll get both a boxing game and a party game. This is an incredibly wacky game in every imaginable sense, with its colorful visuals giving a hint of the fun to be had.

Despite its chaos, it's relatively easy to participate. Fighting arenas in these games are characterized by their enormous boxing gloves and stretching arms, with players facing off in a wide variety of locations, yet somewhat uninspired. As for the balance, other games in the genre suffer from the same frustrations as this one does.

**Features:**

• Convenient controls and simple concept

• It plays easily with little effort

• Younger gamers will enjoy this game because it isn't violent
