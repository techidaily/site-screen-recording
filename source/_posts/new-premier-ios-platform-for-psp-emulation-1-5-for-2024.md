**Key Features:**

* You can view consoles on your iPhone using this powerful PPSSPP app. They have a transparent area around the screen that does not cover the real screen.
* The developers regularly update this tool, and new games are also added.
* The BIOS file is embedded with this app, so you do not need to obtain it from another source.
* For this app to run, you do not need a jailbroken device.
* With the app, you will find a tutorial that will walk you through the entire installation and use process.

## Conclusion

These are some of the best PSP consoles for iOS users. There is no doubt that PPSSPP is one of the first and one of the most user-friendly consoles. However, if you are encountering any issues with PPSSPP, you can go for other options that are also pretty good. Sometimes, user preferences also play an essential role here.
