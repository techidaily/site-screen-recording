One such program is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) by Wondershare. Although Wondershare Filmora is primarily used for industry-standard post-product tasks such as video editing, apply effects and filters to the motion clips, etc., it offers the option to [record computer screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), webcam, and audio as additional features so you don’t have to depend on any other software for screencasting.

Once the meeting session is over, press **F9**, or right-click the **Screen Recorder** icon from the notification area, click **Open recorder**, and then click the **Stop** button from the panel that appears next to stop the recording.

Now, you can drag the recorded footage from the **Media** box to the Filmora timeline at the bottom to start editing the clip, and then can click **EXPORT** from the top of the interface to save the final version of the video that can be shared on your preferred platform or with your colleagues, team members, managers, etc.
