You can easily search and download Terraria Mods from this loader. It provides you with a wide range of options ranging from controls, loading, downloading, and more.

It is a simple and easy-to-use mod that enables you to destroy the entire vein of bricks just by hitting a chunk of bricks.

![boss-checklist-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boss-checklist-poster.jpg)

Playing Terraria and adding several mods at a time can be very confusing. Terraria already contains a wide range of bosses, and after adding mods, the number of bosses increases to a very large scale. This will make it hard for you to have in mind what you have accomplished and what you have to accomplish next. This Boss Checklist mod will be beneficial in that case. It will provide you with an in-game list of all the bosses and activities you have achieved and have to achieve. It almost supports all kinds of mods which makes it one of the best Terraria mods. However, if you have added a small mod, it might not support Boss Checklist because it depends upon the permission provided by each mod to Boss Checklist to access the progress.

**Features**

* Keep record of everything you do
* Check what you have accomplished
* Check what you have to accomplish
* Keep record of every boss you kill

#### **Conclusion:**

It is fun to play Terraria but the fun and thrill will be doubled by adding the above mods. Each of the above mods comes with different features and options. You can add all of the above mods at a time but doing that will lead you to confusion and make it difficult for you to play. That's why we have described each of the mods in detail to help you choose the one that best suits your needs and requirements. Indeed, several other mods are available on the internet but I have tried to select only the best Terraria mods for you.
