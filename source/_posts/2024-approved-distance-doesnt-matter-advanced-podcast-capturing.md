### What factors contribute to podcast success?

High-quality podcasts are more likely to succeed. Having high-quality audio can give your podcast a more professional appearance. Additionally, it will help you strengthen your entire business strategy and draw in pay-per-click advertisers. A wise long-term investment in the success of your podcast is high-quality recording equipment.

## Summary

Regardless of your platform, you might still want to utilize an audio editing application to polish and perfect your interviews. A crucial ability for a podcaster is to learn remote podcast recording. By informing your guests to utilize an external mic (USB mics are acceptable) and ensuring all noises and distractions are kept to a minimum, you can help screen your guests and get them ready for the interview.
