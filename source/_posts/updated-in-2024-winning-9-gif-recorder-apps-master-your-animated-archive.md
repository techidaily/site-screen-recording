Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

The software also features the editing mode to add subtitles to your animated GIFs or export image frames.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

On the other hand, GIFs are small in size, and sending them via email or posting them on social media networks won't require you to wait for a long time until the file is uploaded to the web.
