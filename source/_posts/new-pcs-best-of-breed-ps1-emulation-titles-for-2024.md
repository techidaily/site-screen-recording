## PC's Best of Breed: PS1 Emulation Titles

Sony released its first standalone console for video games, Playstation1 (nicknamed PS1), in 2001\. The PlayStation 2 was released to compete with Nintendo's SNES, which ruled the console video-gaming market for years. Sony launched its first-ever gaming console after years of reorganizations and partnerships, including ones with Nintendo. The console was immensely successful until its successor replaced it.

* Compatible with most gaming consoles, including the PlayStation One, it is very accurate in its compatibility.
