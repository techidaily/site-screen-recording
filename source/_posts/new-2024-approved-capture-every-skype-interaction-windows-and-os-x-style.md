To prepare it for sharing with other participants, click on the “Publish” button. It will open a “Save and Publish” window where you can name the recording file, specify the location to save, and under the options chose what parts of the meeting to include i.e. video, audio, panorama video, messaging, and presented content. When everything is ready press the “OK” button to save the recorded meeting.

## Conclusion

Skype for Business allows the presenters to **record skype meeting** with all the details like video, audio, PowerPoint slides, etc. The in-app recording feature records every members’ video and audio at the same time. For the limitations of call recording on Mac, Wondershare Filmora can also be a good choice for you. It offers unparalleled features with an intuitive design, and you can record unlimited Skype calls and that with no limitation on Windows or Mac computer systems.
