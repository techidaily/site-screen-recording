### 3\. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/)

Wire’s Main Features

Some of the features that make Wire such a fantastic video calling app for pc (Windows 10) are:

* End-to-end encryption makes it a secure way to send videos without being traced.

### 5\. [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/)

The one that everyone knows by name (and by far the most popular video calling app for PCs) is Skype.
