**Google meet mute** is a highly effective feature available to the participants in a meeting. Sometimes there may be distortion in the background, so individuals can mute their mic to avoid any disturbance in the meeting. It is possible for the host to mute an attendee in the meeting, or themselves as well. While the person is muted, they can still listen to what is being discussed in the meeting, but other members will not be able to listen to them until they are unmuted.

So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of **how to mute a Google Meet** is fairly simple.

All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.
