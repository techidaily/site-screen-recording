Step 5: Open FaceTime on iPhone and make the video call. Your video call is getting recorded on your mac through QuickTime.

Step 6: Once you are done, click on Stop button to stop recording. Go to File> Save option to save the recording on your device storage.

## The Bottom Line

Hopefully, you have the answer to your question “Can you record FaceTime on Mac or iPhone?” The steps to record FaceTime get easier when you have the latest macOS and iOS installed on your respective devices. This is because of the presence of inbuilt screen recording feature. For Mac, we recommend Filmora for flawless and high-quality FaceTime call recording. iPhone users can record their iPhone FaceTime screen through their Mac as well.
