• Multiple export options, including burn-to-DVD  
• Text & titles editor  
• Advanced audio editing features  
• Music library feature  
• Speed control  
• Picture-in-picture capability, split screen, green screen, tilt-shift, and more

Another point in its favor: Wondershare Filmora for Mac is one of the least expensive options for users who want a robust video editing tool for Mac. Low price combined with ease of use, shallow learning curve, and extensive features makes Filmora a title to watch among the crowded field of all-in-one video capture & editing tools for Mac.
