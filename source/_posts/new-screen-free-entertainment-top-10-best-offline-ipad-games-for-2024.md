A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.

#### **7\. Drop 7**

**Price:** Free

An inventive puzzle game that mixes Tetris with Sudoku. There are seven balls on the grid, each one of them white or numbered one through seven. It's easy to follow the rules.

A ball will clear whenever there is the same number of balls in a column or row as its features. The white ball cracks and breaks if it removes next to it, revealing a numbered ball.

Tetris' objective is to keep the balls on the top of the screen while racking up points. Despite being simple, it is challenging and fun. There is no need to download anything to experience everything offline.

**Price:** Free

Daily crossword puzzles are set to a high standard by Will Shortz, editor of the New York Times Crossword. With the New York Times Crossword app, you'll have access to the latest crossword every day, as well as the entire archive of past ones.

There are many other features included in the app, in addition to the puzzles themselves. The Stats page allows you to track your streaks, and the archive will enable you to do puzzles from the past or buy special crossword packs.

A Crossword subscription can be purchased separately or as part of a New York Times Digital Subscription. The Mini crossword isn't nearly as fun as a full crossword, so you'll only be able to access it if you don't subscribe.

You can keep an unlimited amount of crosswords offline for later play, even if you don't have access to the Internet to download.

Taking it in turns and passing it to your friends in front of you is part of the game's Pass-and-Play mode, but it is also excellent as a solo game. The games are designed to keep you occupied on a real-life trip on the train, taking fifteen to twenty minutes each.
