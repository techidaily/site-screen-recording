This application is recommended to beginners for its super easy and interactive design layout. There are four basic buttons highlighted on the screen that can serve most of the editing needs. Free Webcam Capture tool is easily available on [official website](http://www.freewebcamcapture.com/), and anyone can download it with ease, but the sad truth is that developers offer the least support for this software tool.
