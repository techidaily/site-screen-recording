## Part 2\. How to Record Gameplay with OBS

Even though OBS is slightly complicated to use but it is very effective for live streaming and recording gameplay. The software is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. You need to download the software from the official website and install it. Here are the steps you need on how to record switch gameplay with OBS.

Step 1: Launch OBS on your computer.

Step 2: On Sources tab, click on “+” button and select Game Capture.

Step 3: Give it a name and click on OK button.

Step 4: From Mode, select Capture Any Fullscreen Application.

Step 5: Click on OK button and the Game Capture will appear under Sources.

Step 6: Open your game on full screen and come back to OBS and you will see the game on the window.

Step 7: Go back to your game and press the Hotkey to start recording and start playing. Otherwise, you can click on Start Recording button on OBS and go back to game and start playing and the recording will be going on in the background.

We suggest you follow the above-mentioned steps as well for your query on how to record switch gameplay with OBS.

## Part 3\. Best OBS Alternatives to Record Games

If you are not comfortable with OBS and you are looking for a professional gameplay recording with a proper video editor, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora Recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You can record gameplay with webcam and mic so that you can showcase your gaming screen along with your reactions and commentary. In general, you cannot upload your gameplay straight away on online platforms. You have to edit out the boring parts and add some effects from better aesthetic value.

Filmora comes with a built-in video editor where you can trim and crop, add audio and video effects, change green screen background, add texts and logos and much more. Naturally, such an edited video will get traction immediately over any straightforward gameplay recording. The first step is to download and install Wondershare Filmora on your computer. Here are the steps to follow to record gameplay with Filmora.
