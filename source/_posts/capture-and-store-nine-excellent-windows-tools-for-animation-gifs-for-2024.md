Screencasting on any version of Windows 7/8/10 is a simple task, and countless software products enable you to record your desktop activities.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.

Most screen recorders create MP4 or MOV files that can get quite large, making them hard to send or easily distribute over the Internet.
