For gamers, DemoCreator's game recording mode stands out among other screen recorders. It allows for the highest quality recording, unaffected by the user's computer monitor resolution, and the game's movement does not impact the recording. Unlike the gameplay recording using ordinary screen recording, which is influenced by the user's computer and monitor, DemoCreator's game recording can support 4K/8K recording at 120 fps.

For users who prefer not to show their faces in videos, the Virtual Avatar mode is ideal. So far, DemoCreator is **the only Mac screen recorder offering virtual avatar recording with expression and motion capture**.

For business purposes, the Video Presentation feature helps users record and live-stream presentations professionally. It is compatible with all popular video conference platforms, including Google Meet, Zoom, Skype, Microsoft Teams, and more.
