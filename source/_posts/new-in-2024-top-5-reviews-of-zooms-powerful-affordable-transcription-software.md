Another advantage of having **Zoom meeting transcription**  is that it can be referred to anytime you miss out on some parts during the implementation of the process the attendees of the conference had agreed upon.

Keeping the above in mind, following is a list of some of the best **Zoom call transcription**  software that can be used to **transcribe Zoom meeting**  with efficiency and least efforts. One of the following sections also discusses a few tips and tricks for the best transcription.

### 1. Automatic Audio Transcription in Zoom

Zoom is capable of recording your meetings and conferences, and storing them onto its Cloud server from where they can be obtained and manipulated as needed.

#### Prerequisites of using the Automatic Audio Transcription in Zoom

* You must have an Education, Business, or Enterprise subscription of Zoom
* You must have Cloud recording enabled for your account
* You must be the owner of the account or have Admin privileges

#### How to transcribe the Zoom audio automatically

Once everything is in place, you can follow the steps given below to enable transcription, and **transcribe Zoom meetings** :

##### Step 1: Enable Cloud Recording

Use your favorite browser to log in to Zoom’s web portal, go to **Settings**  from under the **PERSONAL**  section on the left, go to **Recording**  from the right section, go to **Cloud recording** , and turn on the **Cloud recording**  toggle button to enable the feature.

## Tips for Transcribe Zoom Meeting Recordings

Although the programs discussed above are efficient in their own way, they can generate accurate transcription only if the source files are healthy. Following are a few tips you must keep in mind while recording a Zoom meeting for transcription:

#### Tip 1: Get a Clear Audio Recording

Make sure that you follow the best practices about the input and output device placements and positioning suggested by Zoom professionals. While using a smartphone, ensure that it has enough battery to last at least for a couple of hours, and doesn’t exhaust during the meeting. For laptops, it is advisable to use an average quality headset with a microphone instead of onboard speakers and mic.

#### Tip 2: Meeting Transcription Software Security

While subscribing for any third-party transcription service, make sure to check their privacy policies and confirm if they are agreeable. Since you will be uploading quite sensitive information that may contain your trade secrets, only the service provider with good privacy policy and robust encryption algorithms should be allowed to handle your files.

**Conclusion**

**Zoom transcriptions**  come in handy when you plan to discuss some crucial matters in a meeting, and want all the details to be documented with proper timestamps. In case it is a video conference that is to be recorded, you can choose a service provider that offers close and open captioning as well.
