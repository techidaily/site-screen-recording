4. **[Desktop Video Conferencing tools](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** are the ones we are most familiar with. We all use our devices to connect to one single group video chat.
5. **Room based Video conferencing frameworks using Codec** – a video conferencing tool that is best used when someone needs to communicate with a whole room while they are moving around.
