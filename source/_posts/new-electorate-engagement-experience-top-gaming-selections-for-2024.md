There are several types of election simulation games. Some require analytical and critical thinking skills, some require creative thinking, and others are based on fun and adventure. Pigeon POOlitics is a fun game based on humor and focuses on the ridiculous side of elections. This game enables you to control a group of pigeons and poop over any candidate you want. Sounds interesting, right! Pooping on the opposite party member can turn them into your chosen political party member. As you proceed in the game, you visit a new state with new characters and different people with each new level. In each state, poops works differently on people. People can also through things at you in order to avoid your poop. If you want to survive, you have to defend yourself from such things. Pigeons are not alone in their mission. Several other birds can join them such as Sparrows and Owls. Apart from fun and adventure, Pigeon POOlitics also provides its players with unbiased and useful information in order to help them decide on the reforms correctly.
