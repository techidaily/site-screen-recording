**Step 1:** First and foremost, go to your **Google account page** using the browser and **log in** to your account.

**Step 2:**: After you've logged in, click on the **Personal Info** tab available vertically on the menu bar on the left side of your screen.

**Step 3:**: Under the Name section of the page, tap on the right-side arrow of the screen to proceed further.

**Step 4:**: A new page will open, asking you to enter your first name and last name into the fields provided there.
