**Step 1:** First and foremost, go to your **Google account page** using the browser and **log in** to your account.

**Step 2:**: After you've logged in, click on the **Personal Info** tab available vertically on the menu bar on the left side of your screen.

**Step 3:**: Under the Name section of the page, tap on the right-side arrow of the screen to proceed further.

**Step 4:**: A new page will open, asking you to enter your first name and last name into the fields provided there.

**Step 5:**: When you're done entering the correct spelling, tap on the **Save option** available right under the name fields to save your new name.

Tips: If you don't want to waste any time and do this quickly, paste the link <https://myaccount.google.com/name> in your browser search bar. This will direct you straight to your Google Account name settings, and then you can change the name displaying on Google Meet as well.
