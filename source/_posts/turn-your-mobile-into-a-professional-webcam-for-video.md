For that reason, in this article, we are going to show you five different ways how to turn your smartphone including iPhone and Android phone into a webcam in order to create high-quality webcam recordings.

### Method 1: Using IP Webcam App via Wi-Fi

Google Play grants you access to a lot of different webcam apps, but most of them don't provide a high-quality service. [**IP Webcam**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en) application performs better than most of its competitors, and it enables you to quickly connect your phone to your computer through the Wi-Fi connection.

#### Step 1 Connect to Same Wi-Fi Network

In order to turn your Android phone into a webcam, you'll first have to connect both your computer and your Smartphone to the same Wi-Fi network.

For that reason, in this article, we are going to show you five different ways how to turn your smartphone including iPhone and Android phone into a webcam in order to create high-quality webcam recordings.

## How to Turn Your Android Phone into A Webcam?

A camera on your Android phone can be easily connected to a computer and turned into a webcam. If for some reason you can't use the camera on your laptop and you don't want to spend money on purchasing an external webcam, then these methods of turning an Android phone into a webcam video recorder may assist you in producing a great presentation or sealing an important business deal.

### Method 1: Using IP Webcam App via Wi-Fi

Google Play grants you access to a lot of different webcam apps, but most of them don't provide a high-quality service. [**IP Webcam**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam&hl=en) application performs better than most of its competitors, and it enables you to quickly connect your phone to your computer through the Wi-Fi connection.

#### Step 1 Connect to Same Wi-Fi Network

In order to turn your Android phone into a webcam, you'll first have to connect both your computer and your Smartphone to the same Wi-Fi network.

#### Step 2 Connect to Same Wi-Fi Network

Once you've accomplished this, you can proceed to download and install the IP Webcam app on your Android device. Make sure that all other apps on your phone are closed and launch the IP Webcam application.

We recommend you to set up your login and password in Local Broadcasting under Connection Settings Tab for security reasons.

#### Step 3 Connect IP Webcam via Chrome/FireFox

Insert the URL displayed on your phone's screen into Chrome or FireFox web browser on your computer and press Enter.

After completing these steps, you can start a recording session directly from the web browser you're using by clicking the Record button.

You can also copy the URL displayed by on the phone's screen into the VLC Media Player to record the video.

That’s how to turn your Android phone as a webcam to record video by using the IP Webcam app. You can also download the IP Webcam Adapter on your computer too and then use your Android as a video source for Skype video chat. Check the video made by CNET and find out the specific steps.

### Method 2: Using DroidCam App via USB Connection

Enabling the Developer mode on your Android device is the first step you'll have to take if you would like to turn your phone into a webcam via the USB port. Once you are in the Developer Mode you have to switch on the USB Debugging option. Here's how you can do this.

#### Step 1 Enable Developer Mode on Android

Open the Settings menu on your Android phone and tap on the About Phone feature. You'll be able to see the Build Number option, tap on it several times and the Developer Mode on your phone will be enabled.
