Step 4: When you want to stop recording, open the guide again by pressing Xbox button and press “X” button on your gaming console. You can view the recorded video from Recent Captures.

## Way 2\. Use A Recorder with Capture Card

When you use Xbox One directly to record your gameplay, you can record only for a limited time based on the available storage space. Besides, you have to transfer the recorded video to your computer for editing and uploading on various online platforms. Therefore, it is better that you capture your gameplay on your computer and you will need a capture card for high-quality recording. A capture card is necessary for connecting a computer with a gaming console. Once you buy a compatible capture card, here are the steps to follow.

Step 1: Connect Xbox One, capture card and your computer through HDMI cable.

Step 2: Connect Xbox One to your TV and connect capture card to your computer through USB or data cable.

Step 3: Turn on Xbox One and press Xbox button. From the guide, go to Profile & System> Settings on your TV screen. From Settings, go to System> Console Info to check if Xbox One system is updated.

This will ensure that what you see on your TV screen is also displayed on your computer. Now, you will need a professional [screen recorder application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to record your gameplay as well as edit it out before publishing on any platform. We recommend Wondershare Filmora which is both a professional screen recorder as well as video editor. You can record your gameplay with webcam and microphone as well. Here are the steps to follow on how to record Xbox one gameplay with voice.

Step 1: Download and install Wondershare Filmora.

You will get a few seconds to start playing your game before recording starts. Press F9 on your keyboard to stop recording.

## Way 3\. Use Windows Game DVR

If you want to record a short clip of your gameplay instantly and share on YouTube or other online platform, you can do it easily with Game DVR option available on Xbox One. Game DVR automatically records gameplay in the background and keep them in the buffer so that you can save any recent happening in your gameplay. Otherwise, the recording will get discarded automatically. However, there are many who disable Game DVR feature because it uses system resources significantly. Here are the steps on how to record gameplay on Xbox One.

Step 1: While you are playing a game on Xbox One, press Xbox button twice.
