The equalizer in the application has dozens of features that will allow you to mix any of your recordings with background tracks, voice-overs, and many more digital effects. Here's more about it:

## Part 1\. Key features of Sound Studio

If you are looking for powerful recording software that can give you industry-leading features, then Sound Studio is the best choice for you. It is specifically designed to provide an ultimate user experience with fewer complications and the highest quality output. And with the new updated version from Sound Studio, you will have even more functions on your lap. The following are some of the best features of the Sound Studio application:

**1\. High-quality music output**

One of the basic requirements for any audio recorder is that the output quality for the recorded files must be crystal clear and shouldn't be of low quality. And Sound Studio meets all these aspects in voice recording by providing its users HD quality output sounds with simple and easy steps.

**2\. Multiple formats support**

The application is also enabled with multiple audio format supports which means that there are several formats in which you can create your record as well as export it. You can work with voice recordings from MP3 or M4A files and then you can save them in different formats such as AIDD and WAV.

**3\. Fast and convenient editing**

The user interface along with the software integration of macOS gives Sound Studio a very fast yet convenient editing studio feature. In this section, you will be able to create your audio in several layers and save it with different digital effects such as reverb, delays, chorus, or even flange filters.

**4\. Digital conversion**

The application also allows the users to visit their memory lane by helping them digitize the tapes as well as vinyl records from their PC itself. In this way, everyone can save their old dusty records into digital formats which will enable them to modify the voice configurations and then edit them with different layers of effects.

**5\. Batch processing using AppleScript or Automator**

For people who want to process their audio in a batch or want to combine different audio recordings at the same time, they can use the AppleScript or any Automator for the same since Sound Studio supports the integration of both thus enabling a more powerful part of audio processing.

**6\. Live performance recording**

There are situations where we want to record the ongoing live performances from our systems and in such scenarios, Sound Studio can help you efficiently. With built-in live recording mode, you can record the live performances from voice actors almost instantly with the push of a few buttons on your system.

**7\. Digital noise cancellation**

The application also cancels out the extra and unnecessary voices from the background after you record any voice in the Sound Studio. Thus, when you play it with enabling the digital noise cancellation feature, you will be able to listen to clear sound without any disruption from the outside world.

**8\. Regular updates**

Updates are the most important things for any software since the developers provide a clean experience with each new update and try to remove the bugs and issues reported by users. Also, Sound Studio developers provide regular updates to all their users with just a one-time subscription.
