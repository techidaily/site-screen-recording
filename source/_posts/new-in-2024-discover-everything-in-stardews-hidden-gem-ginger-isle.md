However, those who already play the Stardew Valley game will be capable of venturing into the quests and solving them. To proceed to Stardew Valley Ginger Island, you will need to restore the community center. Note that this particular task will get players closer to being capable of visiting Ginger Island. However, to restore the community center, you will need to create bundles for no one else but the Junimos. The Junimos are found living inside the community center. By creating all the bundles for the Junimos, they will assist you in restoring the community center. When you are done repairing the community center, you will need to be capable of helping Willy fix his already old boat.
