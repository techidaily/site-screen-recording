## Way 4\. Record PS3 with OBS Studio

If you are looking for a way on how to record ps3 gameplay for free, OBS Studio is your solution. OBS is a popular software in the gaming community through which most gamers live stream their gameplay on Twitch and YouTube. However, the OBS Studio is a great scree recorder and you can record PS3 gameplay easily. However, you will first need to stream your gameplay on your computer screen for OBS Studio to capture.
