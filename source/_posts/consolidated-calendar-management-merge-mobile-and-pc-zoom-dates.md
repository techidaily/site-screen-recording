## How to Sync Zoom Meetings to Google Calendar on Android Phones?

 Owners of Android phones must install [Zoom for Google Calendar](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/zoom%5Ffor%5Fgsuite/364750910244) add-on if they want to sync their Zoom meetings with Google Calendar. The add-on enables you to add Zoom meetings to events in the calendar and includes the details of a meeting in order to simplify the process of joining a meeting for the attendees.

 Once you’ve installed Zoom for Google Calendar add-on Zoom meetings will be added to the calendar as soon as you add a new guest. In case you want to disable this feature you should use your Google Admin Console to access the Apps menu, open G Suite and click on Calendar. Navigate to the Sharing menu, go to the Video Calls section and make sure that the Automatically Add Video Calls to Events Created by a User option is not marked.

 If you would like to [schedule a meeting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from an Android phone, you should launch Google Calendar, and tap on the plus icon to select an event. Proceed to insert the title, guest list and other details of the meeting you’re creating and tap on the Add Conferencing option.
