Hit the Record button to initiate the video recording session. You can hit the Esc or End buttons to stop recording if you are using a PC, while Mac users can perform the same action by hitting Cmd + Enter keys.

#### Step 4 - Publish the video

Upon the completion of the video recording session, the Publish Video Demo window will appear on the screen. You'll be able to save your video as an MP4 file directly to your computer, or you can export the video directly to YouTube, Facebook or Twitter.
