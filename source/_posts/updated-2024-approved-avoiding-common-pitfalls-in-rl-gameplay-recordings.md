Well, OBS Studio is equally useful in recording your gameplay. In fact, the software is available free of cost and there is no dearth of advanced settings to better gameplay recording. The user interface is not as easy as other gameplay recorders but here is how to record LOL games with OBS Studio.

## Way 3\. Record LOL Games with Windows Game Bar

However, there are reports from gamers that when you record your LOL games through Windows Game Bar, the game performance can lag at times. If that is not the case with you, you can use Windows Game Bar to capture screenshots and record gameplay in simple steps.
