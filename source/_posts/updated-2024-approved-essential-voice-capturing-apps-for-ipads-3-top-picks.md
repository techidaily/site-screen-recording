## FAQs

Q1\. What is the format in which the iPad records audio?

Ans: iPad usually uses MPEG-4 codec to record and playback audio files. The Voice Momo app uses Advanced Audio Coding codes, a compressed file. Hence, it does not take much space on the hard drive of your iPad. You can also edit the files in the future and send them across to your friends and loved ones over the net.

Q2\. Can you use another app while recording?

Ans: While you are recording, you can use another app. However, you must ensure that the app does not play audio, or the Voice memo will stop recording. Moreover, if you are using another app, you can return to your recording app by clicking on the orange icon. You will find the orange icon on the top of your iPad screen.

Q3\. What happens if your Voice Memo is turned on in iCloud settings?

And: One of the fascinating features of the iPad is that if you turn on the iCloud setting of the Voice Memo, you will be able to access it from anywhere and from any device with the same ID. Hence, once you log in to your device with the same Apple ID, you will access all the recordings you have recorded earlier.

Q4\. What are the advantages of using a Voice recorder app?

Ans: A Voice Recorder app is handy as you can record anything wherever you are. Moreover, since they have noise reduction technology, the recordings are clear and sharp, and hence you will be able to follow every syllable of the audio. Therefore, it is beneficial for students and journalists as you will share your notes easily.
