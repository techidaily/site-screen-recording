As a screen recorder, there is no dearth of features on Adobe Captive to record professional-quality videos. Here are the key features of Adobe recording software that matter the most while recording the screen.

Capture Everything - Apart from capturing screen activities, the software captures all mouse movements, keyboard activities as well as system sound to clear the video as much perfectly as possible.

Standard Editing - Adobe screen capture software lets you edit the recorded video to add transitions, insert texts and images, draw smart shapes and highlight boxes, add voiceover and audio effects. You can add another video in Picture-in-Picture format, and you can publish your recorded and edited video on YouTube with a single click. Besides, you can add pan and zoom effects, trim video clips, and split video into different sections.
