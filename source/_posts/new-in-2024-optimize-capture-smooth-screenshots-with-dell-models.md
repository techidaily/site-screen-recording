If you do not want to get a dedicated screen recorder application on your Dell laptop, you can opt for an online screen recorder as well. In this article, we have illustrated how to screen record on Dell laptop in all possible ways.

## Way 1\. Record with Game Bar

You most likely have Windows 10 installed on your Dell laptop. Windows 10 comes with an inbuilt screen recorder called Game Bar. You can record your screen as well as capture screenshots as per your requirements. You even capture your system as well as external mic audio.
