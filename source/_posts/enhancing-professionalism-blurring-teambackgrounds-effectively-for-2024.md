## Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?

Microsoft Teams allows you to blur the background of the webcam footage before you start or join a video call, during an ongoing session. The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.

## FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background

**Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?**

**A1)** If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.

On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:

* Sign out of Teams and then sign back in
* Check for and update the webcam driver
* Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams
* Restart your computer

**Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?**

**A2)** Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease. You can find more details on the features and compatible programs on the (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options>) link.

**Step 1: Start a New Meeting**

Launch Microsoft Teams on your iPhone or iPad, ensure that the **Chat** icon is selected from the bottom of the interface, tap the **Instant meeting** (**Camcorder**) icon from the top-right corner of the screen, and tap **Start meeting** from the bottom of the box that appears next.

## FAQs about Blur Teams Meeting Background

**Q1) Why can’t I blur my background in Microsoft Teams?**

**A1)** If you’re unable to see the ‘Blur’ tile or the ‘Background settings’ option altogether, probably your PC doesn’t have Advanced Vector Extension 2 (AVX2) graphics. While Microsoft is still working to make the ‘Blur’ option enable for all the devices, no official statement from the organization has been released to date.

On the other hand, if your computer has AVX2 and you still cannot see the option, you can try a couple of things, and see if any of those works for you. For instance, you can:

* Sign out of Teams and then sign back in
* Check for and update the webcam driver
* Check for and install the most updated version of Microsoft Teams
* Restart your computer

**Q2) Can I blur the background in the Teams Business version?**

**A2)** Yes, you can. Microsoft Teams (Free), Microsoft 365 Business Basic, and Microsoft 365 Business Standard versions allow you to blur the background with ease. You can find more details on the features and compatible programs on the (<https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/microsoft-teams/compare-microsoft-teams-options>) link.

## Part 1: How to Blur Background on Teams on a Windows Laptop Before or During a Video Call?

Microsoft Teams allows you to blur the background of the webcam footage before you start or join a video call, during an ongoing session. The methods of getting this done on the laptop computers are explained below in detail.

The following sections explain **how to blur the background on Teams** both before and during a video call while working on a Windows laptop. The step-by-step instructions are given below:

### Method 1: Blur Background on Teams Before Video Call

If you have a meeting scheduled at a particular time but don’t know what to do with that homely background that wouldn’t go with the professional ambiance, luckily Microsoft Teams lets you blur it quite conveniently. The process is described as follows:

**Step 1: Initiate a New Meeting Session**

Launch Microsoft Teams, and make sure that the **Chat** icon is selected in the left pane. From the top of the **Chat** pane, click the **New Meeting** (**Camcorder**) icon, and click **Start meeting**.

![Start Microsoft Teams video call on Windows laptop](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-video-call-teams.jpg)

**Step 2: Check the Devices**

On the **Meeting with** box, make sure that the **Video** and **Audio** switches present under the preview screen are enabled. Turn them on if they’re disabled. Next, click the **Background effects** (**Person**) icon from under the preview screen.

![  Microsoft Teams background blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/microsoft-teams-blur-background-option.jpg)

**Step 3: Blur the Background before video call starts**

From the **Background settings** pane that appears next, and click to select the **Blur** tile. After this, you can safely click the **Join now** button to start a Teams video meeting with the blurred background.

![  Microsoft Teams background blur](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-video-background-microsoft-teams.jpg)

**Note:** While using other operating systems/laptops like Linux, Chromebook, etc., the process of blurring the background before a video call is identical. This means all you need to do is, initiate a new video meeting, click the **Background effects** (**Person**) icon from under the preview screen, and select the **Blur** tile before clicking the **Join now** button.

### Method 2: Blur Background on Teams During Video Call

If you started or joined a Teams meeting without blurring the background, and want to do so during an ongoing call, you can follow the instructions given below to learn **how to blur background in Teams** while in a virtual conference session:

**Step 1: Open the Background settings Pane**

During an ongoing video call, click **More actions** from the upper-right area of the meeting window, and click **Apply background effects** from the menu that comes down.

![  blur background during Microsoft Teams](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-background-effects-microsoft-teams.jpg)

**Step 2: Blur Background during the video call**

When the **Background settings** pane opens on the right of the window, click to select the **Blur** tile.

**Step 3: Save the Changes**

From the bottom of the **Background settings** pane, click **Apply** to blur the background. Optionally, you can click **Preview** to see how the screen would look upon blurring, and apply the changes only when you are satisfied with the output.
