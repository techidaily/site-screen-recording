## The Bottom Line

If you are confused if you should install Screen Recorder Pro to record your screen, well, you should go for it as all the standard features and functionalities are available.

## Part 1\. Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro

Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade. Even though it is available free of cost, the features and functionalities are enough for high-quality screen recording activity. You can not only record the screen activities but also from the webcam. Moreover, you can record only a selected area of the screen rather than the entire screen. Here is the list of features Screen Recorder Pro has to offer.

**Key Features –**

* Record the entire screen or specific area and screen.
* Capture click and keystrokes effectively.
* Record video from webcam with audio.
* Capture audio from microphone as well as speakers.
* Save in different formats like MP4, AVI, and GIF.

## Part 2\. How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro

The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –

Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording. To capture screenshots, you should click on Camera icon located just beside Record button.

Once the recording is done, click on the same button(Stop icon) to stop recording.

## Part 3\. The Editor’s Review

Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.

Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.

Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.

Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.

## Part 4\. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10

If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.
