## Way 4\. Record VR Gameplay on PS4

There is no doubt that playing VR games is more fun on gaming consoles than on computers. When you are playing VR games with your VR headset, it feels more natural to play the game from a gaming console rather than playing from a keyboard. If you use PlayStation 4 as your VR console, you can use the built-in recording option on PS4 to record virtual reality gameplay. Here are the steps you need to follow minutely.

Step 2: Select Sharing and Broadcasts option and go to Length of Video Clip option.

Step 3: Now, you should select the length of your gameplay recording as per requirement. You can choose from 30 seconds to an hour.

Step 4: Go to Audio Sharing Settings and turn on “Include Mic Audio in Video Clips” option.

Step 5: Open your VR game and start playing it. Press Share button on PS4 twice to start recording in the background. The recording will go on as per the duration you set in Step 3.

Step 6: If you want to stop recording manually, press Share button twice.
