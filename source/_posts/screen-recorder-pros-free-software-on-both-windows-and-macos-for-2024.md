For many years, computer instructors face the fierce challenge of instructing another user to perform a specific task on their own computer. Things become harder when the user is away from the instructor. In fact, it is far harder than programming or managing a database because in this case, you have to deal with another person with a different mind-set. No matter how hard your efforts are, you will feel tired at the end of the day more likely with less satisfactory output with ordinary instructional methods. As a great alternative for this, you can seek the help of a screen recording software to make the teaching or instructing effective and productive with minimal efforts. There are many [screen recorder](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) software for you to pick when you browse through the internet.

Screen recording is an extremely efficient way to present something to an audience (especially for a novice audience) precisely on both Windows and Mac. It wipes away all the doubts and difficulties.

Being a free software, Jing still is backed up with the technical support of the TechSmith. However, Jing is not the best software tool for you when it comes to big projects, and you have to sign up and connect to your TechSmith account to use. Besides, as a free screen recording software, Jing allows you to capture screens up to five minutes and the best frame rate is 10FPS, and the recorded videos will be saved in SWF flash format. So, before downloading this free screen recorder on your Windows PC or Mac computer, make sure if you are OK with that.
