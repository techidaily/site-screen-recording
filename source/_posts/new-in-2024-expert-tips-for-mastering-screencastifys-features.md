## 4\. Best Screencastify Alternatives

Although the Screencastify extension is a great tool with a dozen of export configurations and editing tools, its usage is limited to the Google Chrome web browser and if you are using any other application for surfing on the internet, then this application is pretty much useless to you.

However, if you need a screen recorder or a video editing application, then the following are some of the best ones available out there.

### 1\. Screencast-O-Matic

The first application that we are discussing is called Screencast-O-Matic and is one of the best alternatives available for Screencastify. It works on multiple operating systems and can be used by beginners too. This application comes with almost all the features same as Screencastify and has additional tools for webcam support with the recorded screen videos. With Screencast-O-Matic, you will be able to install and record your screen without leaving the comfort of your browser.

![screencast-o-matic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/screencast-o-matic.jpg)

It is a complete package of tools that helps its users create stunning videos for effective communication. The application is very efficient in creating educational videos for both students as well as teachers. These screen-recorded videos are perfect for demos, coaching, meetings, and marketing. And when you are done creating your videos, you will be able to share them on your favorite platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, email, and many more without any complications.

### 2\. Loom

If you are looking for an application that can handle your needs for office work and video recordings, then Loom is the most effective application for you. Loom is a video recording and sharing application that is available on Mac, iOS, Windows, Chrome OS as well as other major operating systems and can be used effortlessly by almost everyone. Originally the application was developed as a system to send video messages with screen recordings or recordings from the webcam.

![loom recording extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-loom.jpg)

But with the new updates, it has more tools available to the users than before. Now along with an instant sharing option to different platforms, it also has multiple editing tools. Now you can click the start button to record a video and after you are done you can instantly edit it to change the contrast, brightness, and many more. And then you will be able to export it to your desired quality.

### 3\. Filmora

Filmora is another application that can be a great alternative to Screencastify because of its robust tools and efficient user interface. It has become a popular name for video recording as well as editing applications amongst users. The main reason for its popularity is because of its availability in different operating systems. Also, Filmora is embedded in key editing tools such as cropping, adjusting the contrast, brightness, and other key features as well as trimming and cutting the videos.

![filmora recording settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/recording-05.png)

As if it wasn't enough, there is the built-in screen recorder in this application that is made by WonderShare and is preinstalled in the Filmora package. Using this you can record your PC or laptop screen without any complications. The free trial version has limited access to the quality and format of the video but when you subscribe to the premium package, a whole new world of configurations as well as tools are available for you.

## Conclusion

Today, we live in a world where screen recorders have immense importance and Screencastify is one of the most promising applications available out there. It is fast, reliable as well as available on all the OS. And this web-based application works amazingly on the Chrome web browser which makes it popular. In case you are not using the Chrome browser, then you can also use alternative screen recorders that can be used in any other browser that has been explained in this article.
