Q2\. Can you use another app while recording?

Ans: While you are recording, you can use another app. However, you must ensure that the app does not play audio, or the Voice memo will stop recording. Moreover, if you are using another app, you can return to your recording app by clicking on the orange icon. You will find the orange icon on the top of your iPad screen.

Q3\. What happens if your Voice Memo is turned on in iCloud settings?

And: One of the fascinating features of the iPad is that if you turn on the iCloud setting of the Voice Memo, you will be able to access it from anywhere and from any device with the same ID.
