Screen recording, now a days is in high demand because of monetized work on social media, from which people around, are making a good lot of money.

Now, the skill is something that we cannot teach you but for the remaining aspects the screen recorder applications are used, which, not only record the screen but most of them offer video editing and other operations on the files.
