## How To Record Google Voice Call On Computer?

Google Voice is available for smartphones as well as computers through its web portal. You get all the features in its web version as the app version. The steps on how to record Google Voice calls on a computer are exactly the same as in the app. However, the fact that Google Voice sends alerts to the other person when you start or end recording is annoying for many.

This is especially undesirable when you want to record a stalker disturbing you through repeated calls, and you can have evidence to produce to officials to take steps. If the stalker gets to know that you are recording, he will cut the call. That is why you need a better alternative to Google Voice recorder. When you are using Google voice through our computer, you can use Wondershare Filmora to record both audio and video which will show the caller number, call duration, and other data. Here are the steps to record your Google Voice call on your computer through Filmora.
