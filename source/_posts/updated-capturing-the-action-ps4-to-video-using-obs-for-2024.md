Step 3: Select the recording screen size. For gameplay recording, full screen is preferable. You can select the external microphone if you want to record your live commentary. Make sure the system audio is correctly selected so that the game audio is captured. You can turn on Record the Camera Stream option if you want webcam as overlay.

Step 4: Once you are ready, click on Record button. You will get a few buffer seconds to switch to your game screen before the recording starts. To stop recording, you can press F9 key.

You can then trim the video, add video effects and transitions, add audio effects, and export it in any desired file format.

## Conclusion

If you want to record your gameplay on your computer when you play with PS4, you need a video recorder. OBS Studio is a default choice and we have stated how to go for OBS studio PS4 in simple steps even though OBS’s user interface is complicated to use. If you want to capture gameplay while you play on your TV, you will need a capture card. If you are looking for OBS alternative, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can record and edit video like a pro.
