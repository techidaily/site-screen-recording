With a user base of more than 210 million people, Snapchat is easily one of the best video chat apps for Android and iPhones. Besides giving you the option to video chat with 16 friends at the same time, Snapchat also offers the possibility to send video snaps or photos that disappear just seconds after you sent them to all of your contacts.

However, calling landlines or mobile phones that don’t have Snapchat installed is impossible, as you can only use this app to video chat with people who are already using it. Doodling over the video while the call is still in progress, applying or creating photo and video filters and discovering where your friends hang out are just a few among countless options Snapchat provides.

After nearly a decade since its initial release, WeChat has more than a billion daily users. You can video chat for free with all app’s users even if they are accessing WeChat from a computer or iPhone. Moreover, you can organize group calls with up to nine people or send photos, videos, or voice messages instantly to all your contacts.

WeChat is also a social media platform that enables you to share the highlights of your day through its Time Capsule feature or post photos and videos on your Moments stream. The app makes it easy to share your location with your contacts, as you just have to tap a button to send exact coordinates to a friend.

This is a simple app that doesn’t have much to offer other than basic video and voice call options. Even so, you can use imo to create video chats with up to 20 participants or group video calls with up to six people. The app enables you to send photos, videos, and all other types of documents to your contacts, but only if they already have imo installed on their device. You must install imo Out if you want to make international calls to contacts who are not using this app.

Imo displays ads, and you have to purchase the premium monthly subscription if you want to remove them and gain access to 25 GB of cloud storage.

### Facetime for Android Alternatives FAQs

#### Can an Android Chat with an iPhone?

Yes, of course, although you can’t use FaceTime, because the app is not compatible with the Android operating system. Installing any of the apps we featured in this article will enable you to communicate with iPhone owners for free, although they will also have the app through which you want to reach them installed on their smartphones. Some video chats also offer the option to call landlines and mobile phones, but this option is not free, and you must find out the rates for the destinations you want to call.

**Conclusion**

Finding the alternative to FaceTime won’t take too long, as there are so many different video chat apps you can use to organize conference calls or group chats. Skype, Facebook Messenger, or Google Duo are some of the most obvious choices, even though millions of people are using apps like WhatsApp, Viber, or WeChat to video chat with their friends and family. Which of the ten best free alternatives to FaceTime on Android do you like the most? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.
