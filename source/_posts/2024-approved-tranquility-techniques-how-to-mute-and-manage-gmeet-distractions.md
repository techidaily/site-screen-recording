## Part 1: How Does the Mute Button in Google Meet Work?

The mute button in Google Meet is like a blessing in disguise, with just one click you can silence your mic. This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else. So, if for instance, you are only a listener in the session and do not want to contribute, then you can mute your microphone.

Additionally, if an individual wants to participate in a meeting, they can unmute their microphone and then quickly mute it again once they have contributed. With just one click, the host of the meeting can also mute everyone in the session so there are no extra sounds or distractions.

## Part 2: How to Mute Your Microphone in Google Meet?

While many believe using the mute feature on Google Meet is a tricky task, the question of **how to mute a Google Meet** is fairly simple.

All an individual has to do is click the microphone button located on the bottom of their screen and they will be muted.

![Google Meet Mute](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-microphone-on-google-meet.jpg)

If they click that same button again, they will be unmuted.

![Google Meet unmute](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/unmute-yourself-google-meet.jpg)

However, if they do not want to make use of the screen to mute and unmute, they can use keyboard key shortcuts. For Mac users, the relevant keys are CTRL - COMMAND - M. If you are making use of a different desktop or laptop then it is simply CTRL - M.

Don’t you just hate it when there is too much distortion or disturbance in a session because of another participant? Well, lucky for everyone, Google Meet has a “remove from the meeting” feature as well.

This way the participant can still hear what is going on in the session, but they are not audible to anyone else.

## Part 6: How to Remove Someone From Google Meet With/Without Being A Host?

Don’t you just hate it when there is too much distortion or disturbance in a session because of another participant? Well, lucky for everyone, Google Meet has a “remove from the meeting” feature as well. In this, individuals can remove other people from the meeting, if they aren’t meant to be in the session or if they are causing challenges in the meeting. They can do this while being the host and even when they are not the host of the meeting.

### 1\. How to Remove Someone While Being The Host?

In the Google Meet window, click on the people icon and a list of participant names will appear on the screen.

Then, from the list with the names of all participants, click on the name of the person you want to remove, then click on the 3 dots next to their name.

You will see 2 options, Pin to screen and Remove from meeting. Click on 2nd option to remove the participant and confirm the command.

### 2\. How to Remove A Participant from Google Meet Without Being A Host

If you are not the host, then regretfully, you can not remove a certain participant from the meeting. However, if you download an extension, that might do the trick to enable this feature.

#### FAQs about Muting People on Google Meet

**Q1) Will people know if I mute myself on Google Meet?**

Yes, people will definitely know that you have muted yourself, as your microphone will appear on the screens of other participants with a canceled sign on it.

**Q2) What To Do If You Have Been Muted in Google Meet?**

If you get muted by someone else in the session, then you can unmute yourself by clicking on the microphone icon at the bottom of your meeting window or press “\*6” keys to unmute yourself.

#### Are you Ready to Use the Mute Function on Google Meet?

The mute feature on Google Meet is truly very simplistic and handy to use. All one has to do is click a few buttons and they are good to go! Follow the process mentioned above, and you will have the easiest time making use of the Google Meet mute feature.
