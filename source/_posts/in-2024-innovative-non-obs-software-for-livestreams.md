## Innovative Non-OBS Software for Livestreams

OBS Studio is one of the most popular desktop applications for recording screen, gameplay, webcam, and external display device video. It is a completely free software that is compatible with Windows, Linux, and Mac. It has all the standard and advanced features for recording and live streaming. However, there are many who are not comfortable using OBS Studio. This is primarily due to its complicated user interface, and they are looking for OBS alternative.

Apart from its steep learning curve for user interface, OBS Studio is not suitable for capturing high-graphics demanding videos and gameplays. This is because it affects the CPU performance significantly and it reduces frame rate that makes the video not as smooth as you expect. The editing options are very limited. That is why we have selected top 15 best OBS alternative for recording.

That said some of its standout features include 4K UHD capture (3840x2160), hardware-encoded gaming recording mode that supports most PC games, support for high FPS recordings up to 120FPS @ 1080p resolution and more customization options compared to OBS while still providing easy drag/drop UI elements that even novices can understand & use easily.

For someone who wants simplicity when recording game steps then Bandicam would be the easy choice since it’s optimized specifically for games where as someone wanting to control every aspect of their recordings in detail they might go towards OBS Studio due to its tedious yet powerful set up capabilities giving them full customization over their content creation process. Ultimately it comes down to what kind of content do you plan on making; if its solely gaming then bands cam fits like a glove but if you’re going beyond gaming into other areas such as tutorials then perhaps OBS may have more potential options available by taking time learning how all its functions work together rather than becoming quickly accustomed to one piece of software without having too many options available at first glance like Bandicam provides.

Apart from being a great editing tool (without having audio-editing feature included), Fraps also records full 4K UHD resolution at 30 FPS with no problems: even if you have lower specs machines, Fraps will still work excellently. One last advantage of this program is being widely used by streamers: streaming via Twitch has become much easier today thanks to tools like Fraps that enable streamers (newbies or experts alike) to quickly get started without requiring any technical knowledge or additional hardware resources.

One of the most popular alternatives to Camtasia is OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software). While both applications offer powerful features for capturing and editing videos in real time, there are some major differences between them.

Ultimately; if an individual primarily wants a screen capture program then their best bet may be something like OBS Studio since it is free yet still highly capable compared to something like Camtasia that charges per license costs which could amount quickly depending on usage demands — especially if team collaboration is involved. On the other hand; those dealing mostly with short form media or creating standard screencasts should gravitate towards something like what Camtasia offers since its setup will likely serve their purposes better due to its familiarity compared with navigating around an unfamiliar UI typically associated with open source projects like what comes standard with OBS Studio.

![camtasia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-camtasia.jpg)

With its cloud storage technology, users can easily store their recordings online and share them with peers using shareable links provided by ScreenRec's Collaborate feature.

When comparing ScreenRec vs OBS Studio, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. OBS Studio requires more technical knowledge while ScreenRec requires less effort since there is no need for complicated settings or installation processes. Additionally Street Rec has been designed specifically with the goal of making screen recording easier and faster with simple drag-and-drop features that make editing much simpler than traditional video editing tools available today.

Finally, RecExperts also supports real-time collaboration between participants so everyone can work together simultaneously during an event or workshop.

When it comes down to comparing RecExperts vs OBS Studio both software programs provide useful features for users with varying needs when it comes to broadcasting or recording content My recommendation would depend on what type of project you’re attempting to do - if you’re only looking stream GoPro footage then the provided functionalities within RecEpxerst should cover most regular requirements if not all - however those who require more advanced production techniques such as scene switching might want consider taking a look into OBS studio due its enhanced focus in this area.

Apowersoft has a simple graphic interface that allows anyone to set up their recordings with ease. Even if you’re new to screen recording, no need to worry! Apowersoft offers an intuitive step-by-step tutorial on how best to use their software. On the other hand, OBS Studio has minimal onboarding experience with users expected to be familiar with video editing concepts beforehand. This results in an immense learning curve for beginners, making it seem very discouraging before they even start recording anything.

For both programs, you can select whether you would like the output file saved as a video or gif file, as well as which resolution you’d like the video exported in — from 1:1, 16:9 and 4:3 ratios all the way up to 4K quality resolutions in both portrait and landscape modes. However, when it comes down to actual output quality for playback after capture/export — Apowersoft records at substantially higher frame rates (up to 60FPS) than OBS studio (which is locked into 30FPS maximes).

## 14\. Monosnap

Unlike Monosnap, OBS Studio does not come with an editor but instead uses the existing video materials before upload/broadcasting in order to make changes instead of offering a built-in one from within the software itself. One advantage that OBS has over other similar tools is its multi-track support that allows multiple sources (such as webcams) to be added on the same display window while using multiple windows at once; this helps streamers differentiate between two simultaneous activities (such as playing game and performing commentary).

When comparing Monosnap vs OBS Studio, it's important to keep in mind exactly what each tools offer. For capturing single images or limited chunks of video material, then Monosnap may be more suited since it carries an integrated editor with various annotation options; however, if you're looking for big projects that require broadcasting live broadcasts or producing full intros & outros movies then going with OBS might be better suited since its multi-track support & streaming capabilities provides much more flexibility when compared against MonoSnap's basic featureset

* Record screen video as well as capture screenshots.
* Comes with a drawing tool for editing screenshots.
* Feature of auto-area detection.

Ultimately; if an individual primarily wants a screen capture program then their best bet may be something like OBS Studio since it is free yet still highly capable compared to something like Camtasia that charges per license costs which could amount quickly depending on usage demands — especially if team collaboration is involved. On the other hand; those dealing mostly with short form media or creating standard screencasts should gravitate towards something like what Camtasia offers since its setup will likely serve their purposes better due to its familiarity compared with navigating around an unfamiliar UI typically associated with open source projects like what comes standard with OBS Studio.

When comparing ScreenRec vs OBS Studio, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. OBS Studio requires more technical knowledge while ScreenRec requires less effort since there is no need for complicated settings or installation processes. Additionally Street Rec has been designed specifically with the goal of making screen recording easier and faster with simple drag-and-drop features that make editing much simpler than traditional video editing tools available today.

Finally, RecExperts also supports real-time collaboration between participants so everyone can work together simultaneously during an event or workshop.

When it comes down to comparing RecExperts vs OBS Studio both software programs provide useful features for users with varying needs when it comes to broadcasting or recording content My recommendation would depend on what type of project you’re attempting to do - if you’re only looking stream GoPro footage then the provided functionalities within RecEpxerst should cover most regular requirements if not all - however those who require more advanced production techniques such as scene switching might want consider taking a look into OBS studio due its enhanced focus in this area.

On the other hand, OBS Studio has minimal onboarding experience with users expected to be familiar with video editing concepts beforehand. This results in an immense learning curve for beginners, making it seem very discouraging before they even start recording anything.

For both programs, you can select whether you would like the output file saved as a video or gif file, as well as which resolution you’d like the video exported in — from 1:1, 16:9 and 4:3 ratios all the way up to 4K quality resolutions in both portrait and landscape modes. However, when it comes down to actual output quality for playback after capture/export — Apowersoft records at substantially higher frame rates (up to 60FPS) than OBS studio (which is locked into 30FPS maximes).

## 14\. Monosnap

Unlike Monosnap, OBS Studio does not come with an editor but instead uses the existing video materials before upload/broadcasting in order to make changes instead of offering a built-in one from within the software itself. One advantage that OBS has over other similar tools is its multi-track support that allows multiple sources (such as webcams) to be added on the same display window while using multiple windows at once; this helps streamers differentiate between two simultaneous activities (such as playing game and performing commentary).

When comparing Monosnap vs OBS Studio, it's important to keep in mind exactly what each tools offer. For capturing single images or limited chunks of video material, then Monosnap may be more suited since it carries an integrated editor with various annotation options; however, if you're looking for big projects that require broadcasting live broadcasts or producing full intros & outros movies then going with OBS might be better suited since its multi-track support & streaming capabilities provides much more flexibility when compared against MonoSnap's basic featureset

For someone who wants simplicity when recording game steps then Bandicam would be the easy choice since it’s optimized specifically for games where as someone wanting to control every aspect of their recordings in detail they might go towards OBS Studio due to its tedious yet powerful set up capabilities giving them full customization over their content creation process. Ultimately it comes down to what kind of content do you plan on making; if its solely gaming then bands cam fits like a glove but if you’re going beyond gaming into other areas such as tutorials then perhaps OBS may have more potential options available by taking time learning how all its functions work together rather than becoming quickly accustomed to one piece of software without having too many options available at first glance like Bandicam provides.

## 10\. Camtasia

One of the most popular alternatives to Camtasia is OBS Studio (Open Broadcaster Software). While both applications offer powerful features for capturing and editing videos in real time, there are some major differences between them.

Ultimately; if an individual primarily wants a screen capture program then their best bet may be something like OBS Studio since it is free yet still highly capable compared to something like Camtasia that charges per license costs which could amount quickly depending on usage demands — especially if team collaboration is involved. On the other hand; those dealing mostly with short form media or creating standard screencasts should gravitate towards something like what Camtasia offers since its setup will likely serve their purposes better due to its familiarity compared with navigating around an unfamiliar UI typically associated with open source projects like what comes standard with OBS Studio.

![camtasia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-camtasia.jpg)

* Templates and packages for different types of videos.
* Customize screen recording area.

Its intuitive desktop interface makes it easy to record video clips up to 2 hours long without worrying about losing quality or keyframe accuracy. With its cloud storage technology, users can easily store their recordings online and share them with peers using shareable links provided by ScreenRec's Collaborate feature.

When comparing ScreenRec vs OBS Studio, both have their own advantages and disadvantages. OBS Studio requires more technical knowledge while ScreenRec requires less effort since there is no need for complicated settings or installation processes. Additionally Street Rec has been designed specifically with the goal of making screen recording easier and faster with simple drag-and-drop features that make editing much simpler than traditional video editing tools available today.

Finally, RecExperts also supports real-time collaboration between participants so everyone can work together simultaneously during an event or workshop.

When it comes down to comparing RecExperts vs OBS Studio both software programs provide useful features for users with varying needs when it comes to broadcasting or recording content My recommendation would depend on what type of project you’re attempting to do - if you’re only looking stream GoPro footage then the provided functionalities within RecEpxerst should cover most regular requirements if not all - however those who require more advanced production techniques such as scene switching might want consider taking a look into OBS studio due its enhanced focus in this area.

* Record audio and video simultaneously.

## 13\. Apowersoft Online Recorder

Apowersoft has a simple graphic interface that allows anyone to set up their recordings with ease. Even if you’re new to screen recording, no need to worry! Apowersoft offers an intuitive step-by-step tutorial on how best to use their software. On the other hand, OBS Studio has minimal onboarding experience with users expected to be familiar with video editing concepts beforehand. This results in an immense learning curve for beginners, making it seem very discouraging before they even start recording anything.

For both programs, you can select whether you would like the output file saved as a video or gif file, as well as which resolution you’d like the video exported in — from 1:1, 16:9 and 4:3 ratios all the way up to 4K quality resolutions in both portrait and landscape modes. However, when it comes down to actual output quality for playback after capture/export — Apowersoft records at substantially higher frame rates (up to 60FPS) than OBS studio (which is locked into 30FPS maximes).

* Allows saving the file in different formats.
* Ability to record all types of screen activities.
* Flexible screen capture to a customized region.

## 14\. Monosnap

Unlike Monosnap, OBS Studio does not come with an editor but instead uses the existing video materials before upload/broadcasting in order to make changes instead of offering a built-in one from within the software itself. One advantage that OBS has over other similar tools is its multi-track support that allows multiple sources (such as webcams) to be added on the same display window while using multiple windows at once; this helps streamers differentiate between two simultaneous activities (such as playing game and performing commentary).

When comparing Monosnap vs OBS Studio, it's important to keep in mind exactly what each tools offer. For capturing single images or limited chunks of video material, then Monosnap may be more suited since it carries an integrated editor with various annotation options; however, if you're looking for big projects that require broadcasting live broadcasts or producing full intros & outros movies then going with OBS might be better suited since its multi-track support & streaming capabilities provides much more flexibility when compared against MonoSnap's basic featureset

![monosnap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/monosnap-for-mac.png)

* Record screen video as well as capture screenshots.
* Comes with a drawing tool for editing screenshots.
* Feature of auto-area detection.
* Allows using on different desktop platforms.
* Easy editing with zoom in/ zoom out.
* Area selection zoomer and perfect for making tutorials.

## 15\. QuickTime

QuickTime is an Apple-based platform that allows users to play, record, edit and share audio and video files. This platform is often used by media professionals who need quick editing tools or by people who need access to reliable playback options. In contrast, OBS Studio is an open-source streaming studio application that allows users to create high-quality live broadcasts without needing specialized hardware or expensive software.
