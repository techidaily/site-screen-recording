In fact, there are many companies that organize online seminars, and you can record Google Hangout sessions so that you can view them any time you want.

Apart from meetings and webinars, you can record Hangout calls as per your requirement.

If you have a subscription to any of these two services, here are the steps for Google hangout recording

Step 1: Open your web browser and visit hangouts.google.com.

Step 2: If you are logged into your account, start a meeting by clicking on Video Call option.

## Part 3\. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone

If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.

**For iPhone:**

If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.

Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.

Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.

Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.

Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.

Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.

**For Android:**

Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.
