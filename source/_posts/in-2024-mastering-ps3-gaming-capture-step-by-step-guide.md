## Way 4\. Record PS3 with OBS Studio

If you are looking for a way on how to record ps3 gameplay for free, OBS Studio is your solution. OBS is a popular software in the gaming community through which most gamers live stream their gameplay on Twitch and YouTube. However, the OBS Studio is a great scree recorder and you can record PS3 gameplay easily. However, you will first need to stream your gameplay on your computer screen for OBS Studio to capture. You can use a capture card or a PS3 emulator to stream PS3 gameplay on computer screen. Here are the steps on how to record your gameplay on PS3 with OBS.

Step 1: Launch OBS on your computer. Go to Sources tab, click on “+” button. Select Game Capture from the menu.
