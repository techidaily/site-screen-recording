## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

## Part 3: How to Mute Someone in Google Meet?

There are times when individuals are not aware that the background noise of their surroundings is causing a disturbance in the meeting. That is when muting someone can come in handy! Basically in this, a host or other participants in the meeting can mute an individual based on need. However, there is an eligibility criterion they must adhere to in order to get the muting permissions.

### The Eligibility Criteria To Mute Someone in Google Meet

Before looking into **how to mute someone on Google Meet**, check if any of the following scenarios apply to you,

* During video calls that are hosted through personal Google accounts, only the moderator can mute a person.
* Google Meet calls made through Google workspace accounts only permit a person, from the domain which organized the meeting, to mute a participant.
* During a video call arranged by using an educational Google account, only the individual who has created the meeting / is the owner of a calendar can mute other individuals.

So, if any of these circumstances apply to you, then you can easily mute someone in a Google Meet session. The process involves the following steps,

Click onto a participant’s picture and click Mute or if this step is not working for you, then at the bottom right of your video room on Google Meet, click people , once you do that a menu will appear on the side of your screen.

Click on the arrow next to the name of the person you would like to mute. Once you do that, a drop-down menu will appear with three options.
