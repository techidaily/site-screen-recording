However, they may need to join a video conference while traveling and might not have access to a laptop at that time. Android phones are no less than a blessing in such a scenario. Luckily, you can also share your Android phone’s screen with all the meeting participants. So, you don’t need to miss an important meeting or a panel discussion. Here are steps to share the screen through your Android phone.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-the-Google-Meet"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-the-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up the Google Meet"></a>Step 1: Open up the Google Meet</h3><p>Tap on the Google Meet app icon to launch it and join the video session.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Start-presenting-your-screen-to-the-participants"><a href="#Step-2-Start-presenting-your-screen-to-the-participants" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start presenting your screen to the participants"></a>Step 2: Start presenting your screen to the participants</h3><p>Click on the <strong>three dots</strong> (ellipsis button) appearing on the top right corner of your phone’s or tablet’s screen and choose the <strong>share screen</strong> from the list of options in the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-google-meet-android.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen on Google Meet Android"                ></p><h3 id="Step-3-Confirm-sharing-content"><a href="#Step-3-Confirm-sharing-content" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Confirm sharing content"></a>Step 3: Confirm sharing content</h3><p>Click <strong>start sharing</strong> from the pop-up message displayed on the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-screen-sharing-google-meet-android.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen on Google Meet Android"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-When-Someone-Else-is-Presenting"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-When-Someone-Else-is-Presenting" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Share Your Screen When Someone Else is Presenting?"></a>Part 4: How to Share Your Screen When Someone Else is Presenting?</h2><p>One of the most exciting features of Google Meet is that it allows you to present when someone else is already delivering a presentation. So, if someone has started sharing the screen on your turn or there is some error, you can send a signal to the participant by sharing your screen during their presentation.</p><p>Thus, Google Meet does not restrict other members from sharing screens when already one screen is shared. You can easily share your screen during someone else’s presentation by following a couple of steps below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Join-a-video-conference"><a href="#Step-1-Join-a-video-conference" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Join a video conference"></a>Step 1: Join a video conference</h3><p>Connect to the video conference through the invitation link or code.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: you may create your own meeting if you are hosting a conference.</p><h3 id="Step-2-Start-presenting"><a href="#Step-2-Start-presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Start presenting"></a>Step 2: Start presenting</h3><p>Click the <strong>Present</strong> <strong>Now</strong> to share the screen based on your need.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Confirm-the-action"><a href="#Step-3-Confirm-the-action" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Confirm the action"></a>Step 3: Confirm the action</h3><p>Choose <strong>the Share now</strong> option when a pop-up notification appears, and then your screen will be shared on the meeting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-as-presenter-on-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen on Google Meet when someone else is presenting"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The other member presenting will find his presentation paused till you do not end your presentation and cancel screen sharing.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Share-Screen-and-Presentation-without-Participating"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Share-Screen-and-Presentation-without-Participating" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?"></a>Part 5: How to Share Screen and Presentation without Participating?</h2><p>Google Meet is usually used for video-conferencing between students, colleagues, or business partners. However, it is not obvious that you only use Google Meet to participate in the discussion. There can be a situation when you don’t want to join a video session formally yet need to share a presentation. The good news is that you can share your screen and presentation without formal participation in the Google Meet session. The procedure is slightly different from the regular one. Let’s know more about how to share the screen on Google Meet without joining the meeting.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting"><a href="#Step-1-Open-up-Google-Meet-Invite-Link-and-join-in-the-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting"></a>Step 1: Open up Google Meet Invite Link and join in the meeting</h3><p>Launch the Google Meet website or its application, enter the meeting code or link, or click <strong>start a meeting</strong>.</p><p>Click the Google Meet invite link and then you will see the screen as below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/present-without-participant-google-meet.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating"><a href="#Step-2-Share-screen-without-participating" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Share screen without participating"></a>Step 2: Share screen without participating</h3><p>Tap <strong>Present</strong> and select a preferred window to share. By default, the system audio is disabled. Enable it if you need to share the system audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-on-google-meet-without-participating.jpg"                      alt="  Share Screen without join in Google Meet  "                ></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When you are just sharing the screen with the microphone and camera disabled, other participants will not be able to hear your voice or see you. Similarly, you do not need to turn on the camera and microphone if you are using Google Meet on an Android device, as you can directly share the screen instead of joining a meeting on an Android device.</p><h2 id="Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome"><a href="#Bonus-How-to-Share-Your-Screen-Using-a-Browser-Other-than-Chrome" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome"></a>Bonus: How to Share Your Screen Using a Browser Other than Chrome</h2><p>Chrome is not the only way to access video-conferencing tools. There is no exception for Google Meet. So, you can use all its features, and even access it through any other browser such as Internet Explorer or Firefox. Alongside joining Google Meet, you may also share your screen in Firefox and Internet explorer. Similarly, Opera mini can be used as well to take advantage of the screen sharing feature. Although the process is almost the same as in Google Chrome, users may find a slightly different interface when joining through other browsers. Let’s summarize the procedure in simple steps.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Download-the-preferred-browser"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-preferred-browser" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download the preferred browser"></a>Step 1: Download the preferred browser</h3><p>Download and launch the browser by clicking on its icon on the desktop or toolbar</p><h3 id="Step-2-Open-Google-Meet"><a href="#Step-2-Open-Google-Meet" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Open Google Meet"></a>Step 2: Open Google Meet</h3><p>Search for Google Meet and click <strong>new meeting</strong>.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Log in to your Gmail account first**.** You can also directly access Google Meet by entering its official web address. Moreover, if you are not a host, you need to join the meeting through an invite link or code.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Share-screen"><a href="#Step-3-Share-screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Share screen"></a>Step 3: Share screen</h3><p>Click the <strong>Present now</strong> option and choose the window area you want to share from the drop-down menu. Tap the ‘<strong>allow’</strong> button to start screen sharing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/share-screen-google-meet-firefox-browser.jpg"                      alt="Share  Google Meet screen on Firefox  "                ></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>By now, our step-by-step guide about how to share screen on Google Meet must have answered many questions you might have before reading the article.

You’ll need to have a PlayStation 2 BIOS in order to run certain emulators like DamonPS2 Pro, for example. On Google, you may also download this file and put it into the app’s folder. It’s now possible to choose a game to play after having BIOS installed. The PS2 BIOS will then be requested. Return to tapping the game after selecting the BIOS file.

The frame rate, or “FPS” or frames per second, is a typical indication of a game’s playability. Around 30 is the typical best ps2 emulator android gaming pace. A 0 to 20 fps Android phone game is almost unplayable, 21 to 29 fps is acceptable, and 30 fps and beyond is nearly as enjoyable as playing on a console.</p><p><strong>Do PS2 emulation software and PSX software operate together?</strong></p><p>Ps2 emulator for android, on the other hand, only play PS2 games. FPse, a PSX game emulator for Android, is required if you want to play PSX games on your phone or tablet.</p><h2 id="Conclusions"><a href="#Conclusions" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions"></a>Conclusions</h2><p>The development of ps2 emulator for android is ongoing.

Until these applications are completely functioning and ready for everyone, they aren’t ready for use.</p><p>The greatest ps2 emulator for android so far is DamonPS2 Pro, one of the three apps on our list.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Economical-Systems-Optimized-by-Ideal-OBS-Settings"><a href="#Economical-Systems-Optimized-by-Ideal-OBS-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Economical Systems Optimized by Ideal OBS Settings"></a>Economical Systems Optimized by Ideal OBS Settings</h2><p>In the past two decades, the digital and IT industry is growing at a jet pace. Programmers are inventing more applications to make our life easier. Similarly, the invention of youtube is one of its prevalent examples of all inventions. Billions of people are watching youtube, among them, millions are video streamers. Today Youtubers and other platform streamers are building costly computational machines to stream their videos with high resolutions and frames per second but it’s not the case for everyone like you and I cannot afford to build those high-end PC or Laptops.</p><p>Therefore, after vast research on the internet, our team came up with an optimal solution to show you a way to stream your videos lag-free, jitter-free, and without any blurriness in a costless way possible. We recommend you the best studio software known as OBS for your streaming using the best OBS settings for your low-end PC or a Laptop. These OBS settings will let you record videos for low-end PC or laptops to stream now without any issues. Keeping things in a little hurry let’s straight dive into the real stuff of this article.</p><h2 id="1-Video-Settings"><a href="#1-Video-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Settings"></a>1. Video Settings</h2><p>Since we are concerned about the streaming of video. It is important to know how to set up your videos settings. To set your video settings you need to follow the steps given below.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Go-to-Settings"><a href="#Step-1-Go-to-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Go to Settings"></a>Step 1: Go to Settings</h3><p>First, you will need to launch your OBS software. On the main menu, you have to go to file-&gt; settings. You will see a new window will pop up for settings as shown in the figure below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-video-settings-go-to-settings.jpg"                      alt="obs video settings go to settings"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep"><a href="#Step-2-Settings-That-You-Should-Keep" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep"></a>Step 2: Settings That You Should Keep</h3><p>Starting with base resolution, it is the video resolution that we are going to send to the people who are going to watch our stream. So for the best one, click on it and choose <strong>1280*720</strong>.</p><p>Output tab, which is the resolution of the video that the people will watch. For fast and lag-free streaming it’s best to keep both the output and base resolution the same to avoid any conversion between the resolution by CPU. So click on output resolution and choose <strong>1280*720</strong> again. If you noticed your computer is still lagging then it’s best to change to 480p but below this, it’s not recommended.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-settings-that-you-should-keep.jpg"                      alt="obs settings that you should keep"                ></p><p>After that, it comes to the filter option. There are multiple filter options in this tab but for a fast and better result, you have to choose the <strong>“bilinear”</strong> filter as shown in the figure below. Finally, when it comes to frame per second you gotta be careful here. The more the fps the more it will put load on your CPU means it will become laggy but it is best to keep it <strong>30 fps</strong>, not more than this and not less than this if you are using a low-end PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-3-Output-Settings"><a href="#Step-3-Output-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Output Settings"></a>Step 3: Output Settings</h3><p>Once you are done with the general video settings now it’s time you should come to the output settings. For that, you will need to choose the output from the main vertical tab as shown in the figure below in 1. You will see a new window appears with a variety of settings. Now it’s time to choose the advanced setting as shown in 2 in the figure to see all settings to be edited.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-settings-edited.jpg"                      alt="obs output settings edited"                ></p><p>Let’s move towards the detail settings for the output video for your audience it’s best to choose the settings shown in the figure and below for lag-free and jitter-free video.</p><p><strong>Encoder:</strong></p><p>The first setting is the encoder setting for your output video. There are two options for it, if you are not using any NVidia graphics card and relying on CPU then it is best to choose x264, which will utilize your CPU.</p><p><strong>Rescale Output:</strong></p><p>The rescale output settings should be kept the same as 720p of the video you are streaming.</p><p><strong>Rate Control:</strong></p><p>Keep the rate control CBR.</p><p><strong>Bitrate:</strong></p><p>Normally, for low-end PCs, you should keep the bitrate to 3000 kbps. However, if you are finding it struggling with your PC in the form of a lag or jitteriness then it’s recommended to drop it low till you get the better results. For the NVIDIA card keep the bitrate to 3000 as it is perfectly fine for it.</p><p><strong>CPU Usage Preset:</strong></p><p>It comes with a lot of options to keep your CPU usage for the video. It is best recommended to keep the CPU usage very fast for good results. If you are using an NVIDIA graphics card then it is best to change the CPU usage to “performance” to get the best out of your machine.</p><p><strong>Profile:</strong></p><p>By default, the profile option is disabled and you should keep these settings as it is if you are not using the NVIDIA card but if it’s not so then it’s recommended to choose the “main” on the profiling option.</p><p>So that’s it for the video settings. These are all the settings that you need to adjust before streaming. After doing it so you just need to click apply button below and bingo it is done.</p><h2 id="2-Audio-Settings"><a href="#2-Audio-Settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Audio Settings"></a>2. Audio Settings</h2><p>For a clear and better audio performance, it’s also necessary you keep the optimum settings for the audio too. Well, you don’t have to worry now about the audio too. After reading this article you should keep the same audio settings here for your PC or Laptop.</p><h3 id="Step-1-Output-Audio"><a href="#Step-1-Output-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Output Audio"></a>Step 1: Output Audio</h3><p>The audio settings can be adjusted from two places. Let us discuss the first one. For that, you will need to select the output in the vertical tab and go to audio as shown in the figure below. You will see multiple tracks in these windows. It contains the audio settings for multiple sources. However, if you are using a single it’s good to choose 320 in track one. For multiple, there is no need to change the audio track but to keep the same 320. These are the perfect settings for most cases of the audio settings for your computer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-output-audio-settings-adjust.jpg"                      alt="obs output audio settings adjust"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Audio-Tab-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Audio Tab Settings"></a>Step 2: Audio Tab Settings</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-audio-tab-settings-steps.jpg"                      alt="obs audio tab settings steps"                ></p><p>The audio consists of many settings,it is divided into categories lets start one by one and explain it.</p><p><strong>Sample Rate and Channels:</strong></p><p>It is the resolution of the audio. The more the sampling rate the more the bits of the audio you sent which means the more the quality of the audio improves. However, there is no need to keep it high but an optimum value works well too. Therefore, keep it <strong>48khz</strong> for the best result as shown. Another thing is a channel, which contains a lot of options but most of you will want the <strong>“stereo”</strong> since it’s the most common choice from the streamers.</p><p><strong>Desktop Audios:</strong></p><p>The desktop audio depends on the device you are using for the audio. It is best to use the default if you don’t know about your device otherwise choose USB if you are audio uses the USB port. For the second audio source, you can choose desktop audio 2 and set it accordingly.</p><p><strong>Auxiliary Audio:</strong></p><p>The streamers usually have one mic source but if you have multiple mic sources then you choose up to 4 auxiliary audio ports and set the device’s settings.</p><p><strong>Meter: Decay Rate &amp; Peak Meter Type:</strong></p><p>The meter is a decibel meter (dB). It is a measurement of volume. The more the decibels, the more it is loud. So use the decay rate to choose between fast, medium, and slow volumes accordingly to your needs. The Peak Meter type is used for your CPU usage. IF you have set higher CPU usage then go for the “true peak” otherwise chose “sample peak”.</p><p>Finally, the rest of the options should be kept as default since being a streamer you won’t need them to change and they are pretty much basic hotkeys to set up if you wish to.</p><h2 id="3-Stream-Settings"><a href="#3-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="3. Stream Settings"></a>3. Stream Settings</h2><p>Here are the streaming settings that you just need to follow for your streaming videos. The streaming tab consists of settings for the platform you are going to stream your video.

After going to the main “stream” tab you will see a bunch of options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-stream-settings-tab-service-1.jpg"                      alt="obs stream settings tab service 1"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Streaming Settings</h3><p><strong>Service:</strong></p><p>Here you have to choose the platform on which you are going to stream your videos. It consists of multiple names of popular streaming servers such as youtube, twitch, Facebook live, etc.</p><p><strong>Server:</strong></p><p>This option let you choose a server to upload your streaming.

Additionally, it can be used to video chat with iOS users both remotely and on the go via cellular data.</p><p>FaceTime is compatible with up to 32 people (including your team), assuming they have an iOS device or a Mac. An internet connection is also required for users to make FaceTime calls.</p><p>To prevent users from switching to Android, Apple prefers to keep its apps exclusive to the iPhone and iPad. The reason Apple did not offer iMessage on Android, for example, is because of this.</p><p>FaceTime on iOS 15 offers end-to-end encryption and SharePlay so that users can share music, videos, links, or other media with all other participants during a call. Apple apps will not be available through FaceTime for Android users, but third-party apps should be accessible.</p><p>If you don’t own an iPhone, you can’t initiate a FaceTime call.

Understand that, Valheim is a highly prominent Norse-themed game that is filled with monsters. However, the Valheim seeds are vital for everybody, including the hermits and the speedrunners. More so, Valheim is regarded as a Viking survival simulator. As a player of Valheim, you will be dropped in a mythological Norse world with nothing but your clothes and a request from the mighty Odin. The request states that you should conquer all the forsaken monstrous beasts roaming the lands. Though it seems easy, it gets tricky as you begin to explore the tenth Norse world. As you explore, you will notice that your food resources are getting scarce. While you may be thinking of how to get food, you can grow some crops. In Valheim, you can turn almost all areas into farmlands. Before you delve into planting Valheim seeds, you will need to choose the world you want to begin your adventure. Note that you will be exploring various biomes to get materials and food to survive. The aim is to be the best Viking in this purgatory-looking world.</p><p>This is done easily as the Valheim game will ask players to input their Valheim world seeds or leave the game to select anyone for them. The seeds are a series of numbers and letters. And, they build a generated world that comes with biomes, resources, and, not to forget, enemies.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Valheim-Seeds"><a href="#The-Best-Valheim-Seeds" class="headerlink" title="The Best Valheim Seeds"></a><strong>The Best Valheim Seeds</strong></h2><p>Since each seed will create a different world from the other worlds, you must check our list to find the best Valheim seeds for mining or speedrunners.</p><p> <em>“Note: The seed you select should be in direct line with your preferences in the game. ”</em></p><p>The Valheim players can use their world seeds to enter a world that has well-known challenges and layouts. Every world in this game gets a unique seed code for players to move around quickly. With the seed codes, players can keep notes of every saved world that they create.</p><p>Some of the best Valheim seeds include:</p><h3 id="1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K"><a href="#1-Seed-htsE7kJL5K" class="headerlink" title="1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K"></a>1.Seed: htsE7kJL5K</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-1.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-1"                ></p><p>Since you may want your private Island far away from everything you know, this seed is the ideal one to plant. Aside from trying to get far away, the biomes in Valheim are filled with horrible creatures that can appear at your base whenever they like and destroy everything.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is the seed you know for those who want a piece of land free from any monstrous atrocities. You will spawn it on a small island in the middle of the sea. And, the nearest boss here is Eikthyr. With such a seed, your inner Viking can be aligned with you to build a ship and sail further with plans on discovering newer lands.</p><h3 id="2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt"><a href="#2-Seed-HHcLC5acQt" class="headerlink" title="2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt"></a>2.Seed: HHcLC5acQt</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-2.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-2"                ></p><p>It is regarded as the ideal seed for the speedrunners in Valheim. Players in this world seed can spawn within a starter island with roughly four runes, close by traders and nearby bosses. The biomes here are in a distinct starter continent, plus the fifth boss can be likened to be as close as a raft that skips away. This seed is the perfect realm for the players that want to speedrun their game. While this world comes with four bosses, Haldor is on the Island as well. More so, players will find the fifth boss on a neighboring island.</p><h3 id="3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4"><a href="#3-Seed-0V5BZHkqY4" class="headerlink" title="3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4"></a>3.Seed: 0V5BZHkqY4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-3.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-3"                ></p><p>Even if you think that you are the best in Valheim, you will need to learn how to build a ship to sail and discover materials and biomes. If you never knew, sailing does have a learning curve. First of all, you will need to get the necessary ingredients to make a vessel; then, the next thing is to learn the difference between the three boat types available and how to use the wind on your side.</p><p> <em>“Note: the boat types are Karve, longship, and raft. ”</em></p><p>While in the water, it is advisable to look out for horrifying serpents that dwell in the ocean. Though some players do not want to bother themselves with sailing, the ideal seed for you will be oV5BZHkqY4.</p><h3 id="4-Seed-maypoleplz"><a href="#4-Seed-maypoleplz" class="headerlink" title="4.Seed: maypoleplz"></a>4.Seed: maypoleplz</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-4.jpg"                      alt="valheim-seeds-4"                ></p><p>In such a game that concentrates on surviving and crafting, all the help you need will be gotten. To help the amateur players, developers of Valheim added a unique yet rare structure to the game.</p><p>This structure is known as Maypole. It is furniture that is made available only to some Valheim world seeds. The players themselves cannot craft these Valheim seeds.</p><p>With the seed mapoleplz, you will be capable of spawning in a world that has Maypole lying towards the west. It simply means that if you construct a base around the structure, your character will be getting extra comfort when resting here.</p><h3 id="5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk"><a href="#5-Seed-t9n3WG6dFk" class="headerlink" title="5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk"></a>5.Seed: t9n3WG6dFk</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-5.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-5"                ></p><p>Since Iron is among the best resources one can find in the Valheim game, it must be understood that it is hard to come by. There are so many things the players will need to do to access Iron.</p><p> <em>“Note: Iron is made available only in the Swamp biome. ”</em></p><p>Nevertheless, immediately you unlock the scrap Iron, you can quickly drop it in the smelter to process Iron. Then, you can begin creating weapons and your armor. More so, for those interested in Iron farming, seed t9n3WG6dFk is among the Valheim seeds that have a vast Swamp biome wholly filled with sunken crypts. You can easily explore these crypts and the muddy scrap piles that are prepared to be mined. Bear in mind that before you get to work, ensure that your wishbone is equipped. The wishbone will help in quickly finding the muddy scrap piles.</p><h3 id="6-Seed-42069lolxd"><a href="#6-Seed-42069lolxd" class="headerlink" title="6.Seed: 42069lolxd"></a>6.Seed: 42069lolxd</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/valheim-seeds-6.png"                      alt="valheim-seeds-6"                ></p><p>For those unaware, Haldor is a merchant of Valheim. When searching for the best Valheim seeds, this is the ideal seed you will need if you want to trade with Haldor. With this seed, you will be in a world where Haldor is very close to the point of spawning. You just need to head towards the east from the spawn point and follow the south coast. Then, you are to cross the water until you arrive at the black forest biome. When you find Haldor, you can use your coins to buy items like a yule hat, fishing rod, and anything else.</p><p>You can sell things to Haldor as well. These things could be rubies, silver necklaces, or even Amber. You can engage in selling things in exchange for coins.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>It is worthy to note that we have provided you with a full description of some of the best Valheim seeds.
