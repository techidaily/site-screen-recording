It’s ad-free, doesn’t need root, has no restriction on recording time, and doesn’t apply watermarks. It’s not a terrible bargain at all. After you’ve downloaded it, go through the following steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/az-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="az screen recorder"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=19080710&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smart-seo-tool.com/images/SmartSEOAuditorBox.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Start the AZ Screen Recorder app by selecting it from your app drawer.</li><li>You’ll notice a four-button overlay emerge.

The home button on an iPhone may be accessed by swiping up from the bottom of the display.</li><li>Press and hold the “Record” button. This feature is activated by pressing the Record button for three seconds, after which the button becomes red and begins recording. The time will be red in the top left corner, indicating that you’re still recording.</li><li>Press the red time indication at the upper left of the screen, then tap “Stop” to stop recording.

If you would like to find out how to record your screen on an Android phone or tablet, there are various options on offer such as using an app, connecting to computer via official ADB method and also custom ROMs together with built in facility.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished.

However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2048963/16384" target="_top" id="2048963"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2048963"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="900"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2048963/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer. Here’s how to record your screen on Android without rooting.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo"><a href="#Step-1-Install-Wondershare-MirrorGo" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo"></a>Step 1: Install Wondershare MirrorGo</h4><p>Start the process of setting up your screen recording session by downloading the MirrorGo Android recorder software for free from the manufacturer’s website. Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905"                      border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-in-game-magic-discover-4-ways-to-preserve-your-gaming-sessions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  In-Game Magic  Discover 4 Ways to Preserve Your Gaming Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unwinding-utopia-premier-idle-games/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Unwinding Utopia  Premier Idle Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-add-visual-appeal-with-these-methods-for-yt-video-inclusion-in-ppt/"><u>[New] In 2024, Add Visual Appeal with These Methods for YT Video Inclusion in PPT</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-adoption-trends-for-arvr-shopping/"><u>[New] In 2024, Adoption Trends for AR/VR Shopping</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-frequency-focus-mac-sound-setup/"><u>[New] In 2024, Frequency Focus  Mac Sound Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-harmonyhunter-discovering-audio-dimensions/"><u>[New] In 2024, HarmonyHunter  Discovering Audio Dimensions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-minecraft-filming-101-from-start-to-finish-for-2024/"><u>[New] Minecraft Filming 101  From Start to Finish for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-essential-guide-to-mc-villages-houses/"><u>[New] The Essential Guide to MC Villages' Houses</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-top-10-camcorders-ultimate-picks-expert-reviews/"><u>[New] Top 10 Camcorders  Ultimate Picks – Expert Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-top-6-masterpieces-designing-mc-village-homes/"><u>[New] Top 6 Masterpieces  Designing MC Village Homes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-using-inbuilt-recorders-for-screen-capture-on-huaweis-mate-and-p-series-devices-for-2024/"><u>[New] Using Inbuilt Recorders for Screen Capture on Huawei's Mate and P Series Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-error.techidaily.com/solved-this-device-cannot-find-enough-free-resources-that-it-can-use/"><u>[SOLVED] This Device Cannot Find Enough Free Resources that It Can Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigating-through-top-ps2-games-on-android-devices-a-compre-written-in-english/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Navigating Through Top PS2 Games on Android Devices -

Note: The apps below is for Android KitKat 4.4 and above, if you want to record your screen on Android device running lower versions, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >you can get some inspiration about how to do it here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h4 id="1-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#1-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="1.

Although the app is free to download and install it does have a number of extra features included for real money. Some of the in app purchases include the ability to use the screen recorder without any type of watermark as well as the full features of the app including the magic button. The magic button is a control feature in which you don’t see any of the recording controls on-screen through the process of recording a video. If you’re careful you can often edit the recording controls out of any video that you produce but ultimately the paid version comes with more features including editing tools as well. If you just wanted to record a quick android video on screen however, AZ produces extremely smooth HD videos on a huge number of devices that run the Lollipop version of android.</p><h4 id="2-ilos-screen-recorder"><a href="#2-ilos-screen-recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. ilos screen recorder"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.icos.ilos.uploader" >ilos screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ilos-screen-recorder.png"                      alt="ilos screen recorder"                ></p><p>This screen recorder offers some benefits because it doesn’t require any type of root on your android device. While many screen recording applications do require developer root on your device you can get access to a screen recorder that works on all android 5.0 devices without watermarks, advertising or time limits. Ilos set out to create one of the most functional screen recorders available for android and although this app just handles the recording and not the editing or upload it’s one of the best for video capture on your smartphone because it doesn’t come with any kind of catch.</p><h4 id="3-Shou"><a href="#3-Shou" class="headerlink" title="3.Shou"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.shou.android&hl=en" >Shou <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shou-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="shou screen recorder"                ></p><p>Shou is still a beta application but it features a number of tools that you won’t find in the average screen recording app. As well as having the ability to cast your screen recording to a variety of airplay devices like chrome cast or Miracast you can take a screenshot and activate recording features through gesture control. This eliminates a lot of the hassles that come with seeing recording controls on-screen during captured videos. In order to download the application currently you have to join their Google plus community and follow the direct link to the Google play store. As the app gains more traction and development it may be able to offer more up to its customers as well as be available for full download into Google play marketplace.</p><h4 id="4-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#4-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="4.Screen Recorder"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nll.screenrecorder&hl=en" >Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>Screen Record is an app that is a little more complicated than simply hitting a record and stop button on your screen recordings. To activate screen record you need to decide the amount of time that you would like videos to record for. This capture device is actually only good for capturing up to 120 seconds free. In the paid version of the app however you can save much larger videos. By setting the filename as well as the length of recording you can save a variety of MP4 videos to your SD card. Although this is an ideal for longer videos or potentially producing tutorials on your android device it is great for recording very quick clips and moving animations.</p><h4 id="5-Download-manager-for-android"><a href="#5-Download-manager-for-android" class="headerlink" title="5.Download manager for android"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tt.android.dm.view&hl=en" >Download manager for android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p>This app is primarily a download manager that you can use in your browser but it comes with featured support for ripping music, video and other files from websites. Enter any linking to the download manager and the media can be saved to your device. This download manager features support for very large file sizes and it features speed up support for optimizing your mobile connection.</p><h4 id="6-SCR-Screen-Recorder-free"><a href="#6-SCR-Screen-Recorder-free" class="headerlink" title="6. SCR Screen Recorder free"></a>6. SCR Screen Recorder free</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/src-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt="src screen recorder"                ></p><p>SCR comes in both a free version that’s available for android Lollipop as well as a paid version of the app that comes with extra features. Unfortunately the functionality of this app does require a rooted device and it isn’t currently available to non-root devices. SCR allows you to record both on screen audio as well as audio through the camera microphone. This means that you can record video on the front facing camera as well as have screen capture available for your device as well. The app is still actively in development and the developers will be consistently updating the screen recorder with brand-new development features. They will consistently beat testing the new app and it has perhaps some of the most interesting features for recording tutorial videos out of any screen capture. For $4.99 the full version of this app is well worth a purchase if you plan on recording a lot of screen capture videos.</p><p>Keep these top screen recording apps in mind if you need to record on-screen video with your android device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-apeak-recording-examined-quality-and-features-decoded/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Apeak Recording Examined  Quality and Features Decoded</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-discoveries-await-5-essential-maps-for-richer-gameplay/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Discoveries Await  5 Essential Maps for Richer Gameplay</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-explore-fauna-fun-top-12-android-simulation-games/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Explore Fauna Fun  Top 12 Android Simulation Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-step-by-step-techniques-for-high-quality-lenovo-captures/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Step-by-Step Techniques for High Quality Lenovo Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-smooth-playback-stop-frame-gaps-in-obs/"><u>[New] Enhancing Smooth Playback  Stop Frame Gaps in OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-fundamentals-of-archiving-webcam-conversations/"><u>[New] Fundamentals of Archiving Webcam Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-becoming-a-social-media-storyteller-on-facebook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Becoming a Social Media Storyteller on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-effective-methods-for-transferring-youtube-videos-to-the-social-network/"><u>[New] In 2024, Effective Methods for Transferring YouTube Videos to the Social Network</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-free-chromebook-screen-recording-tools-ranked/"><u>[New] In 2024, FREE Chromebook Screen Recording Tools Ranked</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-in-depth-tutorial-for-immaculate-3d-shapes-perfect-circles-spheres/"><u>[New] In 2024, In-Depth Tutorial for Immaculate 3D Shapes  Perfect Circles, Spheres</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-quick-start-with-screencastify-video-recording/"><u>[New] In 2024, Quick Start with Screencastify Video Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unleashing-your-creative-potential-mastery-of-vocal-overdubs/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unleashing Your Creative Potential  Mastery of Vocal Overdubs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-mastering-minecraft-geometries-circular-and-spherical-designs-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering Minecraft Geometries  Circular & Spherical Designs for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-stream-like-a-pro-top-5-devices-for-live-recording-success/"><u>[New] Stream Like a Pro  Top 5 Devices for Live Recording Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-the-insiders-guide-to-going-live-on-instagram/"><u>[New] The Insider's Guide to Going Live on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-top-editors-for-youtube-writers-and-creators-all-free/"><u>[New] Top Editors for YouTube' Writers and Creators -

But, as you most probably know, most of these documents are large in size and somewhat difficult to share.

Luckily, you don’t have to be a skilled photo editor who knows how to merge several screenshots of a scroll page of any kind, into a single image, because there are many easier ways to accomplish this task.

Record Hangout Sessions on Phone"></a>Part 3. Record Hangout Sessions on Phone</h2><p>If you are using Google Hangouts from your phone and you want to record hangouts call and meeting sessions, we have different methods for iPhone and Android.</p><p><strong>For iPhone:</strong></p><p>If you are using an iPhone with iOS 11 or higher, you do not have to install any external app. This is because iOS 11 comes with an inbuilt screen recording feature. You can get access to this screen recorder from Control Center. If it is not readily available, you have to activate the feature and start recording the screen which is Hangouts calls and meetings here. Here are the steps you have to follow.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="iphone screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Open Settings app and go to on Control Centre.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Customize Controls and find Screen Recording option and turn it on.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts app and start video call or meeting that you want to record.</p><p>Step 4: Open Control Centre on your iPhone by swiping down or up as applicable.</p><p>Step 5: Tap on Screen recording icon to start recording. This will start recording and you can start your Hangouts call or meeting.</p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><p>Android OS does not include any inbuilt screen recording option. Therefore, you have to install an external screen recording app for recording hangouts sessions. We recommend you install Mobizen screen recorder app on your Android smartphone so that you can record your Hangouts sessions as well as anything on your screen. It is a completely free app and there is no watermark issue. Here are the steps to follow to record Google Hangout with Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobizen-screenrecorder.jpg"                      alt="mobizen screen recorder"                ></p><p>Step 1: Go to Play Store and install Mobizen screen recorder.</p><p>Step 2: Open Mobizen screen recorder and you will see some icons on your screen.</p><p>Step 3: Open Google Hangouts and start your video call.</p><p>Step 4: Tap on Record icon of Mobizen screen recorder on the screen to start recording.</p><p>Step 5: When you are done, tap on Stop icon on your screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4599951&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><iframe width="864" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jVnfr5HudQw" title="The Latest and Easiest Solution to Remove Kindle DRM on Windows (without Degrading)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>Epubor Ultimate for Win：Helps you read books anywhere, including the best eBook Converter + eBook DRM Removal functions.</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The answer to the question “Can you record a Google hangout?” is yes. You can use the default Google Hangouts screen recording option if you have G Suite subscription. If not, you can use Wondershare Filmora not only to record Hangout sessions but also edit the recorded video like a pro. If you are an iPhone user, you can use the inbuilt screen recorder.
