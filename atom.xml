As dozens of players swarm onto the map to take on the last opponent, it is clear that this genre is here to stay. The majority of Battle Royale games start with good old shooting points, but some are more creative and introduce new techniques.</p><p>In addition to being unpredictable, exhilarating, and attractive, battle royale games also offer a great fight royale experience. There are different mechanics in each of the BR games, but they all share the same concept; survive until you or your team are the last one standing. Depending on how good you are, you may choose to either hide and take passive fights or engage your enemies in gunfire.</p><p>In this article, we will provide you with a list of some of the best battle royal games that you must try today. Every game in the list is hand-picked after careful consideration of the needs of the gamers. So, without wasting any time let’s get to our main topic.</p><h3 id="1-Fortnite"><a href="#1-Fortnite" class="headerlink" title="1.Fortnite"></a>1.Fortnite</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fortnite-battle-royale-poster.png"                      alt="fortnite-battle-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>In terms of popularity, Fornite is the face of the Battle Royale genre. Fortnite isn’t stopping anytime soon, considering its explosive popularity since the launch of the game and the new content that comes with each release. As well as cross-play, Fortnite gives players the option to turn it on or off.</p><p>There are 100 players dropped onto the map in Fortnite matches, either as a duo, together or as a small team. Your objective is to survive as long as you can. The Fortnite game gives players guns, vehicles, and other items that they can use to build barriers to protect themselves.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s free and works on a wide range of devices.</p><p>• Simplicity and immersion are key characteristics of this game. In multiplayer game, players can switch between games as often as they like, making long sessions much more enjoyable.</p><p>• Aside from the attractive design, it features weekly challenges and updates.</p><p>• To unlock rewards, the V-bucks in-game currency is used.</p><h3 id="2-Apex-Legends"><a href="#2-Apex-Legends" class="headerlink" title="2.Apex Legends"></a>2.Apex Legends</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-legends-battle-royale-poster.png"                      alt="apex-legends-battle-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch (Coming to Android and iOS in 2022)</p><p>A battle royale game that has been a huge success since it launched. Apex Legends is one of the top games on our list. Despite borrowing many elements from its contemporaries, it has unique features of its own, like its Legends, where each has its own personality and gameplay mechanics that distinguish it from the rest. In addition to using engaging seasonal content, Apex Legends also features in-game events that engage players.</p><p>The thing that puts Apex above the rest is its fast-paced, high-quality gameplay that is unlike any other. It is undoubtedly the best of its kind thanks to its focus on storytelling and fluid gameplay. As soon as you get used to Apex Legends’ movement, you won’t be able to play other slower-paced battle royale games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Combat that moves at a breakneck pace.</p><p>• The best movement in the industry.</p><p>• Hero characters give the battle royale genre an interesting twist.</p><p>• There is something unique about every Legend.</p><p>• Using Ping, you can communicate with anyone, anywhere.</p><p>• Squads of 3.</p><p>• You can play it for free.</p><h3 id="3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone"><a href="#3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone" class="headerlink" title="3.Call of Duty: Warzone"></a>3.Call of Duty: Warzone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-warzone-poster.png"                      alt="call-of-duty-warzone-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>The world we live in exhibits a remarkable timeline, one where an extremely popular video game can be played for free, is published by Activision and is based on a potentially huge franchise. We live in such a remarkable world. With a few tricks up its sleeve, Call of Duty: Warzone enters the battle royale fray of competitive multiplayer games.</p><p>Warzone is based on the 2019 reboot of Modern Warfare. In addition, to respawn matches, loadout kits, and other unique battle royale elements differentiate Warzone from its competitors and greatly impact its gameplay. It is hit-or-miss in terms of these additions, but the package as a whole is quite polished. Although it is referred to as a battle royale game, Warzone will appeal to traditional first-person shooter fans.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Map with a lot of information.</p><p>• Gunplay that is fast and responsive.</p><p>• Since there are so many players and there are frequent skirmishes, you can gain something from virtually every match.</p><h3 id="4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout"><a href="#4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout" class="headerlink" title="4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout"></a>4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster.png"                      alt="fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 (Coming to Android, iOS, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in the future)</p><p>It’s the way Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout accommodates all players that make it so great. Despite that, this game is extremely enjoyable even if you’re not a professional gamer. You can expect to see up to 60 players battling each other for supremacy in this game. As you move through the mini-game rounds, fewer players make the cut, and eventually, there’s only one.</p><p>You’ll run, jump, and climb across obstacles in this game, but its quirky presentation makes the experience all the more appealing. One of the best battle royale games out there is Fall Guy, thanks to the colorful characters and the exciting gameplay.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Playing this game is simple and addictive.</p><p>• The design is colorful and friendly for everyone.</p><p>• A structure that rewards round-based performance.</p><h3 id="5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds"><a href="#5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds" class="headerlink" title="5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds"></a>5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation 4 Xbox One, Android, and iOS</p><p>All Battle Royale games have an interesting origin story, but PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or PUBG, has a particularly intriguing story. Before being licensed by Sony Online Entertainment for use in H1Z1, PUBG began as an Arma 2 and Arma 3 mod. Bluehole Studio hired Brendan Greene as a Creative Director of PUBG. This was when PUBG became PUBG.</p><p>A feature boasted by its biggest rival, PUBG lacks the capability of cross-platform play. Players can participate in 100-person sessions in PUBG, and play alone, with a friend, or with a squad of four. It’s imperative that you land where you want after you drop from a plane to start the game, as you need to find armor, weapons, vehicles, and other items that’ll keep you alive when you meet other players.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and atmospheric.</p><p>• This is a novel concept for a battle royale.</p><p>• Growing community through active development.</p><p>• Matchmaking that happens quickly.</p><h3 id="6-Forza-Horizon-4"><a href="#6-Forza-Horizon-4" class="headerlink" title="6.Forza Horizon 4"></a>6.Forza Horizon 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/forza-horizon-4-poster.jpg"                      alt="forza-horizon-4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>Forza Horizon 4 is not a Battle Royale game, but its new Eliminator mode adds a level of similarity. In The Eliminator, 72 players compete to be the last person standing as the zone closes in around them.</p><p>Into the mix comes Forza Horizon 5, which features a huge open world and some stunning scenery from Mexico. Cross-platform support is also available in Forza Horizon 4, though only for Windows and Xbox.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An open-world full of activities and stunning visuals.</p><p>• A total of 450 cars are licensed for the event.</p><p>• Amazing variety and depth of detail.</p><p>• Almost as good as ever, with so many vehicles to unlock.</p><p>• It gives the impression that the world is dynamic because of online functionality.</p><h3 id="7-Spellbreak"><a href="#7-Spellbreak" class="headerlink" title="7.Spellbreak"></a>7.Spellbreak</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spellbreak-poster.jpg"                      alt="spellbreak-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>Battle Royale fans will enjoy Spellbreak. A multiplayer shooter allows dozens of players to battle it out on an ever-shrinking battlefield filled with weapons. Using a violent, magical aesthetic instead of a violent, military aesthetic, Spellbreak makes a great change.</p><p>The game is played using elemental spells in place of guns. You can combine these powers into devastating attacks by upgrading them to stronger versions. A cloud of poison gas can be set ablaze to create a satisfying effect. Players can move freely in Spellbreak, which turns skirmishes into heroic fights along with explosive combat. Want to retreat for a while? Simply release a bolt of lightning.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Battle royale genre reimagined in an engaging, approachable way.</p><p>• A system for creating magic combats.</p><p>• The art style is very post-apocalyptic and fantasy-like.</p><p>• Profiles and cross-platform multiplayer are carried over.</p><h3 id="8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE"><a href="#8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE" class="headerlink" title="8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE"></a>8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-animal-royale-poster.png"                      alt="super-animal-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google Stadia</p><p>A great battle royale game that is free to play is Super Animal Royale. The game features abandoned safari park animals fighting each other with claws and guns instead of humanoid operators. The developers of Super Animal Royale have done an excellent job for an independent game.</p><p>The game can be played on almost every platform. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, macOS, PC, Google Stadia, and Nintendo Switch are all compatible with the game. Super Animal Royale supports cross-platform play as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The visuals are awesome.</p><p>• There is a lot of customization available.</p><p>• There are plenty of unique ideas.</p><h3 id="9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds"><a href="#9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds" class="headerlink" title="9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds"></a>9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The next game takes a silly approach to the formula, and we’re glad it exists. It’s a comedic shooter parody that targets serious shooter franchises like PUBG (hence the name). There are up to 60 players in lobbies, so obviously, you’ve got to be the last team standing. When shot, players are ragdolled to oblivion, which adds to the humor.</p><p>It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it’s difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Multiplayer action that is addicting.</p><p>• Introducing a novel concept of “battle royale”.</p><p>• Support from a large community of developers.</p><p>• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.</p><h3 id="10-Ring-of-Elysium"><a href="#10-Ring-of-Elysium" class="headerlink" title="10.Ring of Elysium"></a>10.Ring of Elysium</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ring-of-elysium-poster.jpg"                      alt="ring-of-elysium-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The Battle Royale game Kicking Things Off capitalizes on the popularity of the genre but comes with enough uniqueness to stand out. In addition to snowboards, hang gliders, and even grappling hooks for getting around the map, its main standout feature is how you move around it.</p><p>Each successive season of the game has had a different weather type, setting, and even volcanic ash to overcome for you. Season 1 was snow-themed, but other seasons have focused on storms and even nuclear power plants. During the final moments of a game, Ring of Elysium also features a rescue helicopter that allows up to four players to make it to the end - resulting in some tense moments. It’s not perfect, but it’s still a blast.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• World-building and graphics are beautiful.</p><p>• Play in a variety of ways.</p><p>• Battle Royale in a different light.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>Those are our recommendations for the 10 best battle royale games you can play this year on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC, among other platforms.

No doubt there are many more. In order to avoid confusion, we narrowed our list to the top 10 battle royale games.</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>In terms of popularity, Fornite is the face of the Battle Royale genre. Fortnite isn’t stopping anytime soon, considering its explosive popularity since the launch of the game and the new content that comes with each release. As well as cross-play, Fortnite gives players the option to turn it on or off.</p><p>There are 100 players dropped onto the map in Fortnite matches, either as a duo, together or as a small team. Your objective is to survive as long as you can. The Fortnite game gives players guns, vehicles, and other items that they can use to build barriers to protect themselves.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• It’s free and works on a wide range of devices.</p><p>• Simplicity and immersion are key characteristics of this game. In multiplayer game, players can switch between games as often as they like, making long sessions much more enjoyable.</p><p>• Aside from the attractive design, it features weekly challenges and updates.</p><p>• To unlock rewards, the V-bucks in-game currency is used.</p><h3 id="2-Apex-Legends-3"><a href="#2-Apex-Legends-3" class="headerlink" title="2.Apex Legends"></a>2.Apex Legends</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apex-legends-battle-royale-poster.png"                      alt="apex-legends-battle-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch (Coming to Android and iOS in 2022)</p><p>A battle royale game that has been a huge success since it launched. Apex Legends is one of the top games on our list. Despite borrowing many elements from its contemporaries, it has unique features of its own, like its Legends, where each has its own personality and gameplay mechanics that distinguish it from the rest. In addition to using engaging seasonal content, Apex Legends also features in-game events that engage players.</p><p>The thing that puts Apex above the rest is its fast-paced, high-quality gameplay that is unlike any other. It is undoubtedly the best of its kind thanks to its focus on storytelling and fluid gameplay. As soon as you get used to Apex Legends’ movement, you won’t be able to play other slower-paced battle royale games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Combat that moves at a breakneck pace.</p><p>• The best movement in the industry.</p><p>• Hero characters give the battle royale genre an interesting twist.</p><p>• There is something unique about every Legend.</p><p>• Using Ping, you can communicate with anyone, anywhere.</p><p>• Squads of 3.</p><p>• You can play it for free.</p><h3 id="3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone-3"><a href="#3-Call-of-Duty-Warzone-3" class="headerlink" title="3.Call of Duty: Warzone"></a>3.Call of Duty: Warzone</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-warzone-poster.png"                      alt="call-of-duty-warzone-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>The world we live in exhibits a remarkable timeline, one where an extremely popular video game can be played for free, is published by Activision and is based on a potentially huge franchise. We live in such a remarkable world. With a few tricks up its sleeve, Call of Duty: Warzone enters the battle royale fray of competitive multiplayer games.</p><p>Warzone is based on the 2019 reboot of Modern Warfare. In addition, to respawn matches, loadout kits, and other unique battle royale elements differentiate Warzone from its competitors and greatly impact its gameplay. It is hit-or-miss in terms of these additions, but the package as a whole is quite polished. Although it is referred to as a battle royale game, Warzone will appeal to traditional first-person shooter fans.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Map with a lot of information.</p><p>• Gunplay that is fast and responsive.</p><p>• Since there are so many players and there are frequent skirmishes, you can gain something from virtually every match.</p><h3 id="4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout-3"><a href="#4-Fall-Guys-Ultimate-Knockout-3" class="headerlink" title="4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout"></a>4.Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster.png"                      alt="fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PS4 (Coming to Android, iOS, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch in the future)</p><p>It’s the way Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout accommodates all players that make it so great. Despite that, this game is extremely enjoyable even if you’re not a professional gamer. You can expect to see up to 60 players battling each other for supremacy in this game. As you move through the mini-game rounds, fewer players make the cut, and eventually, there’s only one.</p><p>You’ll run, jump, and climb across obstacles in this game, but its quirky presentation makes the experience all the more appealing. One of the best battle royale games out there is Fall Guy, thanks to the colorful characters and the exciting gameplay.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Playing this game is simple and addictive.</p><p>• The design is colorful and friendly for everyone.</p><p>• A structure that rewards round-based performance.</p><h3 id="5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds-3"><a href="#5-PlayerUnknown’s-Battlegrounds-3" class="headerlink" title="5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds"></a>5.PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="playerunknowns-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, PlayStation 4 Xbox One, Android, and iOS</p><p>All Battle Royale games have an interesting origin story, but PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, or PUBG, has a particularly intriguing story. Before being licensed by Sony Online Entertainment for use in H1Z1, PUBG began as an Arma 2 and Arma 3 mod. Bluehole Studio hired Brendan Greene as a Creative Director of PUBG. This was when PUBG became PUBG.</p><p>A feature boasted by its biggest rival, PUBG lacks the capability of cross-platform play. Players can participate in 100-person sessions in PUBG, and play alone, with a friend, or with a squad of four. It’s imperative that you land where you want after you drop from a plane to start the game, as you need to find armor, weapons, vehicles, and other items that’ll keep you alive when you meet other players.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Visually stunning and atmospheric.</p><p>• This is a novel concept for a battle royale.</p><p>• Growing community through active development.</p><p>• Matchmaking that happens quickly.</p><h3 id="6-Forza-Horizon-4-3"><a href="#6-Forza-Horizon-4-3" class="headerlink" title="6.Forza Horizon 4"></a>6.Forza Horizon 4</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/forza-horizon-4-poster.jpg"                      alt="forza-horizon-4-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, PC</p><p>Forza Horizon 4 is not a Battle Royale game, but its new Eliminator mode adds a level of similarity. In The Eliminator, 72 players compete to be the last person standing as the zone closes in around them.</p><p>Into the mix comes Forza Horizon 5, which features a huge open world and some stunning scenery from Mexico. Cross-platform support is also available in Forza Horizon 4, though only for Windows and Xbox.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• An open-world full of activities and stunning visuals.</p><p>• A total of 450 cars are licensed for the event.</p><p>• Amazing variety and depth of detail.</p><p>• Almost as good as ever, with so many vehicles to unlock.</p><p>• It gives the impression that the world is dynamic because of online functionality.</p><h3 id="7-Spellbreak-3"><a href="#7-Spellbreak-3" class="headerlink" title="7.Spellbreak"></a>7.Spellbreak</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spellbreak-poster.jpg"                      alt="spellbreak-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC</p><p>Battle Royale fans will enjoy Spellbreak. A multiplayer shooter allows dozens of players to battle it out on an ever-shrinking battlefield filled with weapons. Using a violent, magical aesthetic instead of a violent, military aesthetic, Spellbreak makes a great change.</p><p>The game is played using elemental spells in place of guns. You can combine these powers into devastating attacks by upgrading them to stronger versions. A cloud of poison gas can be set ablaze to create a satisfying effect. Players can move freely in Spellbreak, which turns skirmishes into heroic fights along with explosive combat. Want to retreat for a while? Simply release a bolt of lightning.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Battle royale genre reimagined in an engaging, approachable way.</p><p>• A system for creating magic combats.</p><p>• The art style is very post-apocalyptic and fantasy-like.</p><p>• Profiles and cross-platform multiplayer are carried over.</p><h3 id="8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE-3"><a href="#8-SUPER-ANIMAL-ROYALE-3" class="headerlink" title="8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE"></a>8.SUPER ANIMAL ROYALE</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-animal-royale-poster.png"                      alt="super-animal-royale-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, Nintendo Switch, PC, Google Stadia</p><p>A great battle royale game that is free to play is Super Animal Royale. The game features abandoned safari park animals fighting each other with claws and guns instead of humanoid operators. The developers of Super Animal Royale have done an excellent job for an independent game.</p><p>The game can be played on almost every platform. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X&#x2F;S, macOS, PC, Google Stadia, and Nintendo Switch are all compatible with the game. Super Animal Royale supports cross-platform play as well.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• The visuals are awesome.</p><p>• There is a lot of customization available.</p><p>• There are plenty of unique ideas.</p><h3 id="9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds-3"><a href="#9-Totally-Accurate-Battlegrounds-3" class="headerlink" title="9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds"></a>9.Totally Accurate Battlegrounds</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster.png"                      alt="totally-accurate-battlegrounds-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The next game takes a silly approach to the formula, and we’re glad it exists. It’s a comedic shooter parody that targets serious shooter franchises like PUBG (hence the name). There are up to 60 players in lobbies, so obviously, you’ve got to be the last team standing. When shot, players are ragdolled to oblivion, which adds to the humor.</p><p>It is an ambitious, chaotic work, with crude artwork, over-the-top weapons and items, and a wonderfully chaotic premise. A good first-person shooting game ties the whole thing together, so it’s difficult to put it down. Its design ensures that the gameplay never feels like it is pushed to the background by the jokes, which speaks volumes about the game.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Multiplayer action that is addicting.</p><p>• Introducing a novel concept of “battle royale”.</p><p>• Support from a large community of developers.</p><p>• Each match is unique due to unpredictable variables.</p><h3 id="10-Ring-of-Elysium-3"><a href="#10-Ring-of-Elysium-3" class="headerlink" title="10.Ring of Elysium"></a>10.Ring of Elysium</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ring-of-elysium-poster.jpg"                      alt="ring-of-elysium-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p><p>The Battle Royale game Kicking Things Off capitalizes on the popularity of the genre but comes with enough uniqueness to stand out.

Season 1 was snow-themed, but other seasons have focused on storms and even nuclear power plants.

Microsoft’s PowerPoint program for Windows comes with various customization options for creating a presentation. In addition to text, you can place images, tables, charts, videos, links, and other types of content in your PowerPoint presentation to really make it pop.</p><p>There have been complaints from PowerPoint users about not being able to have direct access to the full detail of the presentation after presenting. One of the most prominent problems is that users want to jot things down, and at the same time, they want to pay full attention to the presenter especially when the presentation is on ‘how to’. There is a tendency to miss little vital information. Also, those who miss presentations on PowerPoint have no hope of getting the presentation in detail.</p><p>Fortunately, there is a solution to the problem. Recording PowerPoint as a video is possible. It is an interesting and helpful idea that could help users go over the whole presentation and get the information as though the PowerPoint presentation is still live. The only difference will be the time at which they watched the presentation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-1.jpg"                      alt="how to record a powerpoint presentation"                ></p><p>This article will:</p><ol><li>Educate you on how to record PowerPoint presentations with video and audio, in a step-by-step approach.</li><li>Show you the benefits of recording PowerPoint presentations.</li><li>Teach you the advantages and disadvantages of using PowerPoint presentations with video and audio</li><li>Recommend a third-party tool to record PowerPoint presentations.</li></ol><h2 id="Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint"><a href="#Part-I-When-you-will-need-to-record-a-PowerPoint" class="headerlink" title="Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?"></a>Part I. When you will need to record a PowerPoint?</h2><p>There are almost 35 million PowerPoint presentations delivered daily.</p><p>PowerPoint slides are the preferred method of delivering supplementary information that enables audiences to comprehend and relate to the concepts and ideas delivered in presentations, whether in classrooms or boardrooms. Presentations can take several forms, including</p><ul><li>Training and tutorials</li><li>Business and sales presentations</li><li>Executive communications</li><li>Product demos</li><li>Educational lectures</li><li>Student assignments</li><li>And more…</li></ul><p>But after they are delivered, what happens to all of those PowerPoint slides? Depending on the content and target audience, a select few will be shared or preserved, either publicly on SlideShare or privately on SharePoint.</p><p>In most cases, PowerPoint slides on their own, without the corresponding presentation — are incomplete and don’t do the best job of communicating the concepts from the actual presentation. Those ahead of the curve should be to share and archive recordings of their full presentations.</p><h2 id="Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio"><a href="#Part-II-How-to-record-a-PowerPoint-presentation-with-video-and-audio" class="headerlink" title="Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio"></a>Part II. How to record a PowerPoint presentation with video and audio</h2><p>You can record a presentation in real-time as you present, or do it in advance to leverage the flipped model or make your presentation available on-demand.</p><p>While there are several ways to record a presentation, this is one of the easiest ways to record a high-quality presentation in PowerPoint with audio and video.</p><h5 id="Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points"><a href="#Step1-Prepare-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Talking-Points" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points"></a>Step1 Prepare Your PowerPoint Slides and Talking Points</h5><p>Before recording your presentation, ensure your slides are organized correctly and error-free. The function of your PowerPoint presentation is to act as a visual aid for the information you’re presenting, not to present all your information for you. Don’t put too much info on your slides so you won’t be tempted to read directly from them.</p><p>The image below shows how your screen will look when your presentation is ready.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-2.jpg"                      alt="prepare your powerpoint slides and talking points"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources"><a href="#Step2-Select-Your-Audio-and-Video-Sources" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources"></a>Step2 Select Your Audio and Video Sources</h5><p>You can record video, audio, or just your slide show directly within the Microsoft PowerPoint program. After you’ve opened PowerPoint, select “Recording” from the top navigation bar. This will open a new navigation bar with “Record Slide Show” and “Screen Recording” options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-3.jpg"                      alt="select your audio and video sources"                ></p><p>If you just want to record your slideshow without adding audio or video, you would select “Record Slide Show”. Choosing “Screen Recording” will let you capture your slideshow while at the same time recording audio from your computer and any video on your computer screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> you can start recording from the beginning or you choose a current slide to start recording from.</p><h5 id="Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen"><a href="#Step3-Open-Your-PowerPoint-Slides-and-Capture-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen"></a>Step3 Open Your PowerPoint Slides and Capture the Screen</h5><p>Choose “Screen Recording,” and you’ll be given the opportunity to select the area on your screen you want to capture. Adjust the red box to fit your Powerpoint presentation. Once you have the box where you want it, you’re ready to record!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/how-to-record-a-powerpoint-presentation-4.jpg"                      alt="open your powerpoint slides and capture the screen"                ></p><h5 id="Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting"><a href="#Step4-Press-Record-And-Start-Presenting" class="headerlink" title="Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting"></a>Step4 Press Record And Start Presenting</h5><p>Make sure the “Audio” button appears gray before you hit the record button. Once you hit record, you’ll begin capturing everything in the area you’ve selected, and any audio picked up by your computer’s mic.</p><p>If you prefer, you can skip recording audio during this step and add it later. Use the “Audio” option from the PowerPoint navigation if you’re trying to find out how to record PowerPoint presentations with audio you’ve already recorded.</p><h5 id="Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below"><a href="#Step5-Export-the-video-to-achieve-this-follow-the-steps-below" class="headerlink" title="Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below"></a>Step5 Export the video: to achieve this, follow the steps below</h5><ol><li>Navigate to File, click Export, and choose to Create a Video</li><li>Select the resolution</li><li>Set timing parameters or use recorded timings and narration</li><li>Click on Create Video</li><li>Choose Save as Type and select between MPEG-4 or Windows Media Video</li></ol><p><strong>Pros and Cons of Using PowerPoint to Record Your Presentation</strong></p><p>Consequently, using PowerPoint to record your presentation has some advantages and disadvantages.</p><p> Pros</p><ul><li>Easy to create with free resources</li><li>Works great for doing web-based tutorials</li><li>Works great for step-by-step explanations</li><li>Create homework help, how-to’s, problem&#x2F;solution videos, and visual presentations that mark up on the screen</li><li>you can both create the presentation within the program and convert it into a video on the spot</li></ul><p> Cons</p><ul><li>PowerPoint isn’t a video editing tool.

Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 1. Get to Know Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 is a completely free screen recording app. The app does not have any premium service to upgrade. Even though it is available free of cost, the features and functionalities are enough for high-quality screen recording activity. You can not only record the screen activities but also from the webcam. Moreover, you can record only a selected area of the screen rather than the entire screen. Here is the list of features Screen Recorder Pro has to offer.</p><p><strong>Key Features –</strong></p><ul><li>Record all screen activities on any application.</li><li>Capture screen with or without mouse cursor.</li><li>Record the entire screen or specific area and screen.</li><li>Capture click and keystrokes effectively.</li><li>Record video from webcam with audio.</li><li>Capture audio from microphone as well as speakers.</li><li>Save in different formats like MP4, AVI, and GIF.</li><li>Capture screenshots instead of videos if required.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Download-and-Record-with-Screen-Recorder-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro"></a>Part 2. How to Download and Record with Screen Recorder Pro</h2><p>The features of the application seem to be great for capturing any screen activities. Besides, there are various advanced options available such as record specific areas or record without cursor. These advance options are generally available in premium screen recorders, but you are getting them for free on Screen Recorder Pro. Therefore, you should definitely download the application on your PC and use it for screen recording. Here are the steps to download –</p><p>Step 1: Go to Start menu and open Microsoft Store.</p><p>Step 2: Search for “screen recorder pro for win10”.</p><p>Step 3: Select the first app from the search result page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/search-recorder-pro-store.jpg"                      alt="search recorder from store"                ></p><p>Step 4: Click on Get button to download and install Screen Recorder Pro APK automatically.</p><p>Once the downloading is complete, you can launch the application from the Start menu.</p><p>Here are the steps to follow to record any screen on your PC.</p><p>Step 1: Launch Screen Recorder Pro application from Start menu.</p><p>Step 2: You need to configure the parameters such as video encoder, FPS, quality, audio source and likewise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/launch-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="launch screen recorder pro"                ></p><p>Step 3: You have to select full screen(monitor icon) or custom screen(area icon at the extreme right corner).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-record-screen-recorder-pro.jpg"                      alt="screen recorder pro customize screen"                ></p><p>Step 4: Finally, click on Record button to start recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10"></a>Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.</p><h3 id="Filmora"><a href="#Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has a built-in video editor. Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro. Besides, the application is suitable for all types of recordings starting from application screen and webcam to videos games and web interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want. As far as the editor goes, you can add sound effects, video effects, transitions, and filters. Moreover, you can insert captions, drawings, and stickers and you can do green screen recording.

The Editor’s Review"></a>Part 3. The Editor’s Review</h2><p>Now, it is time to give you our final verdict and leave no gap between the lips and the cup.</p><p>Performance: The performance of the application is smooth and flawless. Unlike other screen recorders, it does not bring down the performance of the application whose screen you are recording. However, it does take up system resources, and for an old PC, the effect could be significant. But for a modern PC, there is no issue. Therefore, it scores really well as far as performance is concerned.</p><p>Functions: As a standalone screen recorder, the app is perfect from all aspects. Starting from recording full screen and custom screen to recording with and without cursor, all standard features and some advanced features are available. You can configure the settings as per requirements and you can take screenshots and record from webcam and microphone. However, there is no basic editing option available which is a drawback. Besides, the application is not effective in recording gameplay.</p><p>Video Quality: Video quality is standard but not advanced. The video quality cannot compete with premium screen recorder. You cannot record 4K videos and therefore, it is suitable for basic recording and not for professional recording. You cannot even enhance the video quality with editor because it does not come with any editor and it is strictly a screen recorder. All in all, if you want professional video quality, you have to look for alternatives.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3"><a href="#Part-4-Other-Alternative-to-Record-Screen-on-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10"></a>Part 4. Other Alternative to Record Screen on Windows 10</h2><p>If you are not satisfied with the video quality and certain features that Screen Recorder Pro for Windows 10 has to offer, you can opt for better alternatives. Here are the best alternatives to record screen on Windows 10.</p><h3 id="Filmora-3"><a href="#Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Filmora"></a>Filmora</h3><p>Wondershare Filmora is a professional <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that has a built-in video editor. Therefore, you do not need separate applications for recording the screen and editing out video like a pro. Besides, the application is suitable for all types of recordings starting from application screen and webcam to videos games and web interfaces.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/start-recording-screen.jpg"                      alt="wondershare screen recorder"                ></p><p>Most importantly, you can capture at 4K resolution and you can add voiceover if you want. As far as the editor goes, you can add sound effects, video effects, transitions, and filters. Moreover, you can insert captions, drawings, and stickers and you can do green screen recording. Therefore, Filmora scores over Screen Recorder Pro on various parameters. Here is the list of all the features Filmora offers.</p><p><strong>Key Features –</strong></p><ul><li>Capture screen activity as well as gameplay.</li><li>Record screen up to 4K resolution.</li><li>Record webcam with audio as well as from microphone.</li><li>Add voiceover as well as use green screen technology.</li><li>Record and highlight mouse pointer with click sound.</li><li>Add audio and video effects to enhance quality.</li><li>Various interesting object additions possible.</li><li>Super easy to use interface for all levels of users.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h3 id="OBS-3"><a href="#OBS-3" class="headerlink" title="OBS"></a>OBS</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >OBS Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an extremely popular screen recording software and it is particularly popular among video streamers.

However, if you are looking for capturing gameplay, you have to opt for an alternative such as Wondershare Filmora. But for basic screen recording, you do not even need Screen recorder Pro as Xbox Game Bar will suffice which comes installed for Windows 10 users.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>Whenever you take a screenshot on a Mac computer, a file is saved to the desktop by default.
