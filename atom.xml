It’s extremely simple to utilize with numerous social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook Live, and Twitch. Today, we will teach you how to link OBS Studio with Facebook Live and start broadcasting in no time. You may embed scene sources inside scene sources so that the user can control what’s occurring. Using this will enable you to represent a certain scenario throughout a historical period. Nesting sceneries enable you to edit one portion of a scene without having to go through the full scenario. OBS Studio takes your web camera, microphone, and other devices as inputs and works well on all Windows, Mac, and Linux systems. It has a big community, which assures a steady supply of filters, transition effects, overlays, and help if you ever have trouble when working the program.</p><p>On Facebook Live, it’s very simple to generate high-quality live streaming nowadays, but effective live broadcasts take a little know-how and technical knowledge or understanding. OBS Studio allows you to communicate with your Facebook network via HD live streaming. It allows you to make your live broadcasts seem professional and leave a lasting impression. Open Broadcaster Software Studio is a free live streaming application with cross-platform interoperability. It gives you extensive customization choices, enabling you to manage every element of video recording and streaming. In addition to video recording and streaming, OBS can also allow you to capture your computer screen and live stream gameplays in high quality. The program provides a customizable UI to match your needs simply. Many of the OBS features match those seen in paid products. Here, we’ve put together our best advice for maximizing OBS settings for live broadcasting.</p><h5 id="Filmora-Audio-Recorder"><a href="#Filmora-Audio-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Audio Recorder"></a>Filmora Audio Recorder</h5><p>Record computer system audio</p><p>Capture microphone audio</p><p>Customize recording volume</p><p>Record screen and webcam as well</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Part 1: How to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h2><p>OBS Studio provides several wonderful tools for beginner broadcasters who are just getting the swing of live broadcasting. The program contains a set of OBS-specific system requirements to guarantee the most optimum live broadcasting experience. These options include the ability to mix several sources with unique transitions, employ audio&#x2F;video filters and correction tools, and more. First, access the OBS Studio settings by selecting the “Settings” button in the bottom-right region of the program window. The first tab, named “General,” doesn’t include anything particularly significant to examine. However, here, you may pick your language and choose a bright or dark theme.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings"><a href="#Steps-to-Set-up-OBS-Stream-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings"></a>Steps to Set up OBS Stream Settings</h3><p>**<strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you’ve evaluated these options, click on the next tab labeled “Stream” in the OBS Studio settings box. Game capture is suggested for live streaming since it is designed for recording screen material as well as capturing video. Multiple sources may be utilized as scenes, and they can be made visible or invisible with the touch of a button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-up-obs-stream-settings.jpg"                      alt="set up obs stream settings"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->****Step 2:** As soon as you run OBS, you are greeted with the auto-config window, which automatically picks various choices for you based on how you want to use it. The auto-configuration settings may be toggled again by clicking on Tools -> Auto-Configuration Wizard. However, your connection speed may be too slow to handle this bitrate. You may simply confirm whether this is the case by running a speed test.<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tools.jpg"                      alt="tools"                ></p><p>**<strong>Step 3:</strong> On the top, we have the primary canvas showcasing all material to be captured or broadcast. We may add as many sources as we need. There are several choices for visual sources as well as audio channels. By default, the resolution is the same as the laptop screen. At the bottom, various sceneries may be specified. Scenes comprise multiple sources that may be utilized to capture or broadcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/capture-or-broadcast.jpg"                      alt="capture or broadcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135398/19272" target="_top" id="2135398">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135398" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135398/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## Part 2: Connect OBS to Facebook Live<p>OBS Studio can broadcast your videos on all the main streaming networks, including Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Live, and more than 30 similar services. When you live stream on Facebook with OBS Studio, you may experience the host of visual mixing and customization tools of OBS Studio. To alter your OBS Studio settings, you will have to visit the “Output “settings in your OBS Studio account.</p><p>By default, the chosen output mode is “Simple.” To guarantee your live broadcast is reliable and completely functioning we suggest you follow the configuration options offered in the “Encoder Setup” box.

Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio<p>If you are going to record a video playing on your Mac, QuickTime is a great choice. You can record your screen perfectly but the only issue is that QuickTime player screen recording audio feature is not available. That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.</p><p>Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download <a class="link"   href="https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac" >SoundFlower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another.

This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg"                      alt="system preferences"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option. This will make SoundFlower the active output by feeding the audio signal directly to SoundFlower instead of system speakers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-soundflower.jpg"                      alt="soundflower"                ></p><p>Step 5: Now, it is time for QuickTime player screen recording with audio. Launch QuickTime and go to File &gt; New Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 6: You can start recording anytime you want by pressing the Record button.

Steps to Use QuickTime Record Screen and Audio<p>If you are going to record a video playing on your Mac, QuickTime is a great choice. You can record your screen perfectly but the only issue is that QuickTime player screen recording audio feature is not available. That does not mean you cannot record screen as well as audio with QuickTime. Here are the steps on QuickTime how to record screen with sound.</p><p>Step 1: You will have to install a free extension called SoundFlower so that you can record audio through QuickTime along with recording the screen. Therefore, download <a class="link"   href="https://soundflower.en.softonic.com/mac" >SoundFlower <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> free extension software. The main job of SoundFlower is to channel the audio playing from one application to another. Install SoundFlower application on your Mac from the downloaded file.</p><p>Step 2: Once you have installed SoundFlower on your Mac, restart your computer. This will ensure that there is no issue with QuickTime screen recording with sound.</p><p>Step 3: Go to Apple menu and open System Preferences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/system-preferences.jpg"                      alt="system preferences"                ></p><p>Step 4: Go to Sound tab and from Sound Output, select SoundFlower(2ch) option. This will make SoundFlower the active output by feeding the audio signal directly to SoundFlower instead of system speakers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/output-soundflower.jpg"                      alt="soundflower"                ></p><p>Step 5: Now, it is time for QuickTime player screen recording with audio. Launch QuickTime and go to File &gt; New Screen Recording option.</p><p>Step 6: You can start recording anytime you want by pressing the Record button. Make sure that sound source is selected as SoundFlower(2ch) and quality is selected as high. You can record any video that you are playing on the browser as well as record your gameplay with audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quicktime-start-screen-recording.jpg"                      alt="quicktime screen recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982508">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982508">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982508.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982508%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982508/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Step 7: Once you are done recording, press the Stop button.

Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.</p><p>Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134233/18498" target="_top" id="2134233">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134233" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134233/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->## 1\. About OBS Studio<p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Performance:<p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123736/7443" target="_top" id="2123736">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123736" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123736/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### Pros<ul><li>Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li><li>Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.</li><li>Customizable settings from different specifications.</li><li>Work with multiple scenes and input sources.</li><li>Pushes latest updates for improved performance.</li></ul><h3 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Does not have user-friendly interface.</li><li>Excessive CPU usage and frequent crashes.</li><li>Not very suitable for 4K video quality.</li></ul><h2 id="2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop"><a href="#2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.

Thanks to its widgets while recording, you do not have to switch between tabs to check important things. In comparison to OBS Studio, the range of compatibility of video and audio sources is not as wide as expected but the useful widgets are not available on OBS.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>Streamlabs is best for live streaming on Facebook Gaming, Twitch, and YouTube. Get the stream key and run the optimizer to get the best settings to go live. Besides, there is an extremely useful Test mode available to ensure all the things are perfectly working as expected.

However, because of the lack of time or morning blues, you did not clean your room and are hesitant to share your screen you can use the blurred background features.</p><p>After starting the Google Meet meeting or entering the password, you can see yourself on the screen. On the bottom right corner, there should appear a silhouette for Windows users. While for Mac users, there will appear three dots. Move the pointer on the silhouette icon or three vertical dots to view the options.</p><p>Google Meet provides its users with three major fun and convenient options for blurred background Google Meet.</p><ul><li>When you click the silhouette with large dots, you can completely blur the background for Google Meet.</li><li>On clicking the silhouette with smaller dots, you have the choice to partially and slightly blur the background for Google Meet. Therefore, you may not look completely photo edited or creepy, in other words.</li><li>Alternatively, you can choose a funky or decent background. Google Meet allows you to upload your own photo from the laptop and use it as background as well.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-meet-background-blur-options.jpg"                      alt="Google Meet blur background options"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1977023">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1977023">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1977023.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1977023%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1977023/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Primarily there is no difference while blurring the background in Google Meet for android or Mac users; the background blurring option typically rolls out when you have the recent compatible software installed.

We could be traveling and take a business call with the help of our iPhone or Android anywhere. There is, however, a minor restriction when it comes to a phone; we cannot choose any background. With mobile, we have only two options to blur the background for Google Meet. Completely blur or slightly blur.</p><p>There will always be glitches and malfunctions in the technical realm, which can usually resolve by restarting the software or device. However, minimum compatibility requirements must be present if you wish to avail blurred background features for Google Meet on your iPhone or Android.</p><p>You need to be having an Android phone with a minimum 9.0 version. For iPhone users, 6s is the minimum requirement for iOS. In addition, your Android smartphone should have 3 GB RAM, ARM64, 4 CPU cores, 1.6 GHz CPU clock. The majority of typical phones support all of the stated features. So, do not be concerned if you do not grasp all of the technical jargon. Just search the model of your mobile phone online and compare to find out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blur-background-before-google-meet-video-call.jpg"                      alt="Blur background before Google Meet video call"                ></p><p>After entering the password or starting the meeting, you can spot an option to blur on the bottom of the self-view screen.

Apart from playing offline videos, VLC Media Player lets you stream videos from online sources as well as convert videos into different file formats. Besides, there are graphics equalizer and audio normalization available. But one feature that clearly stands out is <strong>VLC rotate video</strong> and save the video file.</p><p>You can rotate a video in VLC clockwise at 90, 180, and 270 degrees.

You can make this rotation temporary for momentary viewing purpose as well as make the rotation effect permanent so that it always opens with the set rotation effect. However, the steps to rotate permanently on VLC are somewhat complex. Therefore, we recommend Wondershare Filmora where you can rotate any video permanently in three simple steps.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

However, at the time of this writing, the Whiteboard feature can only be used on iPads. So, if you’re running Zoom Cloud Meeting on your iPhone, you won’t see the Whiteboard option. Nevertheless, the interface and the options that the Zoom’s iOS variant has are almost identical, and so is the process of sharing <strong>Zoom meeting whiteboard</strong> .</p><p> You can learn how to use <strong>Zoom whiteboard</strong>  on an iPad by following the instructions explained below:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Share-Whiteboard-on-iPad"><a href="#Step-1-Share-Whiteboard-on-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Share Whiteboard on iPad"></a>Step 1: Share Whiteboard on iPad</h4><p> On your iPad, use the regular method to start a new meeting and invite the participants to join the conference, tap <strong>Share Content</strong>  from the meeting control panel at the top, and tap <strong>Whiteboard</strong>  from the menu that appears.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Access-Annotation-Tools"><a href="#Step-2-Access-Annotation-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Access Annotation Tools"></a>Step 2: Access Annotation Tools</h4><p> Tap the <strong>Edit</strong>  ( <strong>Pencil</strong> ) icon from the bottom-left corner to expand <strong>Zoom annotation tools</strong> , tap your preferred icon to add annotations to the whiteboard, and tap <strong>Stop Share</strong>  once you are done drawing.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  Process of doing other things including clearing your annotations or ending the meeting remains the same for both Android and iOS platforms.</p><h3 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Zoom-Whiteboard"><a href="#Frequently-Asked-Questions-About-Zoom-Whiteboard" class="headerlink" title="Frequently Asked Questions About Zoom Whiteboard"></a>Frequently Asked Questions About Zoom Whiteboard</h3><h4 id="1-Can-we-share-multiple-whiteboards-in-a-meeting"><a href="#1-Can-we-share-multiple-whiteboards-in-a-meeting" class="headerlink" title="1.

In order to do this, you must configure Zoom by clicking the small arrow available next to the <strong>Screen Share</strong>  icon, and clicking the <strong>Multiple participants can share simultaneously</strong>  option from the menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zoom-meeting-share-multiple-screens.jpg"                      alt="Zoom Cloud Meeting Whiteboard on Android"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126493/26400" target="_top" id="2126493">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126493" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126493/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->#### 2\. Why can’t I see the Annotation tools?<p> If you have joined a meeting hosted by someone else, it is possible that the host has prohibited other participants from annotating. In this case, you can request the host to enable annotations for the other members.</p><h4 id="3-How-to-collaborate-on-a-whiteboard-in-Zoom"><a href="#3-How-to-collaborate-on-a-whiteboard-in-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="3. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?"></a>3. How to collaborate on a whiteboard in Zoom?</h4><p> If you are a participant in a Zoom conference that has been hosted by another person, collaborating on a shared whiteboard requires you to enter the full-screen mode by clicking the <strong>Full Screen</strong>  button at the top-right corner, clicking and opening the <strong>Options</strong>  menu from the top or bottom (depending on your operating system), clicking <strong>Annotate</strong> , and then continuing with the regular annotation process.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  To be able to collaborate on a whiteboard, it is important that the host of the meeting has allowed the members to add annotations.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p><strong>Zoom whiteboard</strong>  allows you to share your ideas with other participants of the conference. The good thing is, while using a desktop version, you can allow participants to share their whiteboard. You can also allow or prohibit them from annotating on the whiteboard that share. About the mobile versions, Zoom is available for both Android and iOS platforms. However, the latter variant of the app can be installed only on iPad. All in all, Zoom is available for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS devices where all the variants of the program share almost identical interface and therefore can be used seamlessly throughout.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

If you would like to capture longer videos of your screen, you can do so by using free third-party <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, such as AZ Recorder. But if you are using the built-in screen recording feature on Huawei smartphone, the recording function of the third-party apps will be disabled.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos"><a href="#Where-to-Find-the-Recorded-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Where to Find the Recorded Videos"></a>Where to Find the Recorded Videos</h2><p>All screen recordings you create will be displayed in the phone’s <strong>Gallery</strong> app. Locate the Screenshots or Screen Recordings folder on the Albums tab and then tap on the Share icon if you would like to post the recording on social media or send it to a friend. Hit the Delete button to remove the recording from your phone.

Huawei’s Smartphones enable you to accomplish both of these tasks in just a few simple steps. However, the built-in Screen Recorder on Huawei’s Mate 10, 20 P20 or P10 Android devices doesn’t allow you to specify the region of the screen you want to capture or select the frame rate, so if you want to gain access to more powerful screen recording tools you should install an app such as AZ Screen Recorder or DU Recorder from the Google Play Store, but you can also record the screen on the computer with some desktop screen recorders.

They can look stunning, particularly on the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and they can overwhelm with interesting new twists on the tried-and-true shooter concept. They often put us against brainy villains and those who wish to devour them. And they never fail to wow with their speed and flair.</p><p>While talking about Best Fps Games’ first-person shooters are one of the most popular game genres, picking the top 30 examples is difficult. We need a set of laws, but even then, another ten are killed by a headshot for every gunman who makes it through. On this list, we’ll look at games with first-person shooting as their main mechanic. In 2021, the game should be playable right now. Multiplayer FPS and first-person battle royales are hot, while first-person action RPGs like Fallout 4 and action-adventure games like Deathloop are out and known as best Fps games. These are the guidelines. Shooting the messenger isn’t a good idea.</p><p>Without further ado, here are the 7 best Fps games available right now.</p><h3 id="1-BLACK-MESA"><a href="#1-BLACK-MESA" class="headerlink" title="1.BLACK MESA"></a>1.BLACK MESA</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/black-mesa-poster.jpg"                      alt="black-mesa-poster"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983553">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983553">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983553.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983553%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983553/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->Black Mesa is just a fan-made Half-Life 1 remake that runs on the latest Source engine. Black Mesa took 15 years to achieve version 1.0, but it's well worth waiting when it was released in 2020\. To offer a more condensed experience, the remake is a revised version of the classic single-player campaign, with no outdated puzzles or battle sequences. The crew also created an enhanced version of Alien planet Xen, ostensibly cut from Half-Life 1's last chapter.<p>Although there’s no denying the Half-Life 1 is just a great game, particularly in light of what it achieved for PC gaming, its gameplay isn’t without flaws, which are addressed in Black Mesa. Black Mesa is the greatest way to see what you’ve been losing out on if you haven’t experienced the original Half-Life game. Black MESA is included in this list of the greatest FPS games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Recreation of Half-Life.</p><p>• More concise experience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130529/26400" target="_top" id="2130529">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130529" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130529/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->### 2.CALL OF DUTY: COLD WAR BLACK OPS<p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops.jpg"                      alt="call-of-duty-cold-war-black-ops"                ></p><p>Following the success of the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot and Warzone, Black Ops – Cold War needed to live up to Infinity Ward’s expectations.

There are excellent AI partners; genuine people that exist to do more than die hilariously; and mechanics that make the environment feel real and substantial.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Tremendously ambitious game.</p><p>• The blockbuster environment feels.</p><h3 id="6-Escape-from-TARKOV-1"><a href="#6-Escape-from-TARKOV-1" class="headerlink" title="6.Escape from TARKOV"></a>6.Escape from TARKOV</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/escape-from-tarkov.jpg"                      alt="escape-from-tarkov"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->There are a lot of FPS games that claim to be realistic, but none compare to Escape from Tarkov's dev team's fanatical attention to detail when it comes to weapons, attachments, and ballistics modeling. Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.<p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><h3 id="7-TITANFALL-2-2"><a href="#7-TITANFALL-2-2" class="headerlink" title="7.TITANFALL 2"></a>7.TITANFALL 2</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/titanfall-2.jpg"                      alt="titanfall-2"                ></p><p>EA and Respawn improved on what the original game did well, and the multiplayer in this shooter sequel was so perfectly balanced that it became one of the best Fps games of 2016. Titanfall 2’s mix of gritty, industrial mech brawling and agile pilot combat is unparalleled. The solo mode of Titanfall 2 also offers a great introduction to the game’s mechanics and a fascinating, self-contained story, as you’ll discover in our Titanfall 2 campaign review.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Perfectly balanced.</p><p>• Self-contained story.</p><p><a href="#">Try It Free</a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a href="#">Try It
