Webcams are commonly used during screen recording sessions, to capture the footage of the narrator, but a simple mistake like, not paying attention to the video’s background can ruin a perfectly captured webcam video.</p><p>Besides removing the messy backgrounds, you can also add templates or custom made backgrounds to webcam videos if you would like to hide private information, put the accent on the narrator of the video or improve its overall quality. In this guide, we are going to show you how to replace or remove the background while you are recording webcam videos with Logitech webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Record PC screen <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><h2 id="How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#How-to-replace-and-remove-the-background-with-Personify-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="How to replace and remove the background with Personify ChromaCam software"></a>How to replace and remove the background with <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/" >Personify ChromaCam software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h2><h3 id="ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam"><a href="#ChromaCam-for-Logitech-Webcam" class="headerlink" title="ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam"></a>ChromaCam for Logitech Webcam</h3><p>Before you can start customizing the backgrounds of your webcam videos, there are a few preparation steps you have to take. Currently, Personify ChromaCam is available <strong>only on the Windows operating system,</strong> so Mac users can’t install the software even if they own a Logitech C992 Pro Stream webcam and BRIO 4K Pro Webcam. If you purchased these webcam models, you will be asked if you want to install the Personify ChromaCam software for free when you connect the webcam to a computer for the first time.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can download the software from the ChromaCam<a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/download/" >website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if you are not using the Logitech C922 or BRIO 4K webcam. ChromaCam works with all 2D webcams, but you may need to pay.</p><p>The software’s tech specs are not demanding, but you’ll still need to have <strong>at least Windows 7,</strong> or a more recent version of the Windows OS installed on your PC as well as an Intel or AMD Processor and <strong>4GB of RAM memory.</strong> ChromaCam is <strong>optimized for 64-bit Windows,</strong> although it can work on 32-bit version of the OS, and the software can only be used with processors included in the Intel AVX Set. Personify ChromaCam is compatible with a lot of video chatting apps and broadcasting software products, including Skype, OBS Studio, <a class="link"   href="https://www.xsplit.com/" >XSplit Broadcaster software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> (we will take it for example in this article) , Google Hangouts, GameShow or Twitch, to mention a few.</p><p>Regardless of the software, you’re using with ChromaCam, the setup process is fairly simple and it includes only a few easy steps. We are going to show how you can replace and remove backgrounds with Personify ChromaCam using the <a class="link"   href="https://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/c922-pro-stream-webcam" >Logitech C922 Pro Stream <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> webcam.</p><h4 id="Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software"><a href="#Step-1-–-Download-Install-ChromaCam-software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software"></a>Step 1 – Download &amp; Install ChromaCam software</h4><p>Connect the webcam to your PC, and install the ChromaCam software. If for some reason your Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t provide this option, you can download the software from the<a class="link"   href="http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads" >Logitech’s customer support page. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/logitech-c922-chromacam.jpg"                      alt="logitech-c922-chromacam "                ></p><p>Personify ChromaCam works as an add-on for screencasting and broadcasting software products, that allows you to select a new background for the webcam video. The background removal and replacement features the ChromaCam offers enable users to combine several sources of videos while broadcasting live on the Internet’s most popular video streaming platforms.</p><p>The free version of ChromaCam adds watermarks to all videos, and you must pay a $29,99 one-time fee to remove them. However, the free version of the software that comes bundled with Logitech C922 Pro Stream webcam doesn’t create watermarks.</p><p>When the ChromaCam software is successfully installed on your PC, and after you’ve made sure that the webcam is working properly, you can launch the XSplit Broadcaster. If you haven’t installed this software on your PC yet, you can click <a class="link"   href="https://www.chromacam.me/#about" >here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to start the installation process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/personify-chromacam-remove-background.jpg"                      alt="personify-chromacam-remove-background "                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session"><a href="#Step-2-Setting-up-a-new-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session"></a>Step 2 - Setting up a new recording session</h4><p>Once the XSplit software opens, you should head to the <strong>Add Source</strong> menu, and then select the Personify ChormaCam from the Webcam, capture card, video devices drop-down list. The Personify window will pop-up on the screen, and you’ll be able to select a new background for the webcam video by clicking on the templates featured in the Personify window.</p><p>If you’d like to adjust the video recording settings, you should right-click on the C922 Pro Stream webcam and open the Configure drop-down menu. Select the Video Output feature, and proceed to pick the Color Space Compression, Frame Rato or the Output size. The Video Input option in the Configure menu, grants you access to Logitech’s Camera Settings for the webcam and enables you to activate the Low Light Compensation feature, that improves the C922 Pro Stream’s performance in low-light conditions.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options"><a href="#Step-3-Selecting-the-background-removal-and-replacement-options" class="headerlink" title="Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options"></a>Step 3 - Selecting the background removal and replacement options</h4><p>In the ChromaCam window, you can select a transparent background option if you would like to blend the figure into the screen recording or some of the template backgrounds that make the narrator stand out against the background. The software allows you to import custom made backgrounds by clicking on the plus icon in the Personify ChromaCam window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chromacam-interface.jpg"                      alt="chromacam-interface "                ></p><p>Making sure that the figure in the webcam video is properly cropped is the most important part of the process because badly cropped videos reveal too much of the previous background. The software’s cropping precision is limited, although the Personify ChromaCam provides tools that make the figure’s edges smoother.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam"><a href="#Step-4-Recording-with-ChromaCam" class="headerlink" title="Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam"></a>Step 4 - Recording with ChromaCam</h4><p>Before you start a new broadcast or a screen recording by clicking on their icons on the XSplit’s top bar, make sure that you are properly positioned and that the webcam is directed towards you. The Personify ChromaCam focuses on the head and torso of the figure in the video, so try not to move too much. The new background cuts out the parts of the figure that go out into the area of the background that has been replaced or removed, which can produce an awkward visual effect</p><p>You can pause or stop recording with a single click and all you’ll be able to find your videos in the XSplit’s Recordings tab.</p><p>You can also use this software in other screen recording software, please share with us how it works for you in the comment below.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135407/19272" target="_top" id="2135407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135407/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Tips-for-better-background-replacement"><a href="#Tips-for-better-background-replacement" class="headerlink" title="Tips for better background replacement"></a>Tips for better background replacement</h2><p>Changing or removing the background in a webcam video is easy, but there a few things you can do to ensure that all webcam videos created with Personify ChromaCam software meet the highest visual standards.</p><h3 id="1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds"><a href="#1-Use-simple-monochrome-backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="1.

Use simple monochrome backgrounds</h3><p>Complex backgrounds that contain a lot of details should be avoided at all cost because the software won’t know which part of the screen you want to replace. A minimalistic, clean working background that doesn’t contain anything that might distract the viewer or the software, will make it easier for the software to place an outline around the figure and separate it from the rest of the image.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://homestyler.sjv.io/c/5597632/1943647/22993" target="_top" id="1943647">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1943647" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://homestyler.sjv.io/i/5597632/1943647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality"><a href="#2-Find-the-right-balance-between-the-performance-and-video-quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

Find the right balance between the performance and video quality</h3><p>Logitech C922 can capture videos at 60 fps in 720p resolution when used with Personify ChromaCam, but the software also enables you to reduce the screen recording quality you’re producing and increase the quality of the webcam footage. Click on the Setting icon in the Personify window and then just drag the Performance VS Quality slider to improve the quality of the footage produced by ChromaCam. However, lowering the video quality will also decrease the frame rate, so your screen recordings may not be as smooth as they would be if they were captured at the maximum resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134236/18498" target="_top" id="2134236">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134236" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134236/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment"><a href="#3-Use-professional-lighting-equipment" class="headerlink" title="3.

Use professional lighting equipment</h3><p>Logitech C922 webcam performs remarkably well, even under difficult light conditions, but having enough light in the shot will guarantee that the video meets the conventional quality standards. Webcam videos captured under low-light conditions are often blurry and the person featured in the video is hard to recognize. That’s the reason why you should always strive to have a sufficient amount of light in the webcam video, so the ChromaCam software can easily place an outline around the figure in the video. Using more than one spotlight to light the scene can help you remove the shadows cast by a Persona in the video because shadows can make the background removal software less efficient.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-anymp4-screen-recorder-review/"><u>[New] AnyMP4 Screen Recorder Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-essential-equipment-list-secure-your-zoom-sessions-for-2024/"><u>[New] Essential Equipment List Secure Your Zoom Sessions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-historys-heaviest-battles-rts-review-of-7-epic-games/"><u>[New] History's Heaviest Battles RTS Review of 7 Epic Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/n-2024-media-mosaic-maker/"><u>[New] In 2024, Media Mosaic Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-tier-free-screen-capture-programs-2023-edition/"><u>[New] In 2024, Top-Tier Free Screen Capture Programs – 2023 Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-zoom-basics-for-non-experts-setting-up-your-first-meeting/"><u>[New] In 2024, Zoom Basics for Non-Experts Setting Up Your First Meeting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-instagrams-soundscape-feature/"><u>[New] Unlocking Instagram’s Soundscape Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/new-updated-list-of-podcast-interview-questions-to-hook-up-listeners/"><u>[New] Updated List Of Podcast Interview Questions To Hook Up Listeners</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-recording-google-voice-conversations/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Recording Google Voice Conversations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-hd-cameras-for-wildlife-enthusiasts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Top HD Cameras For Wildlife Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-instant-recording-sight-and-sound-fused/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Instant Recording Sight & Sound Fused</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/fixing-displays-out-of-sync-in-windows/"><u>Fixing Displays Out of Sync in Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/impact-of-major-contract-terminations-forces-asetek-to-halt-revenue-estimates/"><u>Impact of Major Contract Terminations Forces Asetek to Halt Revenue Estimates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-access.techidaily.com/in-2024-instantaneous-ease-in-podcast-broadcasts/"><u>In 2024, Instantaneous Ease in Podcast Broadcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/"><u>Network Locked SIM Card Inserted On Your Xiaomi Mix Fold 3 Phone?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Great-Livestream-Showdown-Streamlabs-Vs-OBS-Head-to-Head"><a href="#The-Great-Livestream-Showdown-Streamlabs-Vs-OBS-Head-to-Head" class="headerlink" title="The Great Livestream Showdown: Streamlabs Vs. OBS Head-to-Head"></a>The Great Livestream Showdown: Streamlabs Vs. OBS Head-to-Head</h2><p>When it comes to live streaming on video platforms like YouTube or Twitch from your desktop, you will need a live streaming software. Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.</p><p>Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><h2 id="1-About-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-About-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. About OBS Studio"></a>1. About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144275/7443" target="_top" id="2144275">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144275" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144275/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ul><li>Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li><li>Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.</li><li>Customizable settings from different specifications.</li><li>Work with multiple scenes and input sources.</li><li>Pushes latest updates for improved performance.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148640/16836" target="_top" id="2148640">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148640" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="234" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148640/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Does not have user-friendly interface.</li><li>Excessive CPU usage and frequent crashes.</li><li>Not very suitable for 4K video quality.</li></ul><h2 id="2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop"><a href="#2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.

How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder"></a>Part 2. How to Record Games NVIDIA Screen Recorder</h2><p>NVIDIA ShadowPlay comes under NVIDIA GeForce recording option. This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website. Launch GeForce Experience from Windows Start menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-overlay.jpg"                      alt="run nvidia shadowplay"                ></p><p>Step 2: Once GeForce Experience opens, you have to click on the Share button at the top-right corner. This will open NVIDIA Share toolbar at the top of the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Along with NVIDIA Share toolbar, you will see ShadowPlay overlay UI. There are mainly three options - Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay record button"                ></p><p>If you do not see the overlay containing recording options, click on the Share button at the left of the NVIDIA Share toolbar.</p><p>Step 4: Start the game whose gameplay you want to record. You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.</p><p>Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg"                      alt="run shadowplay recorder"                ></p><p>Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z.

Performance and Requirements"></a>Part 3. Performance and Requirements</h2><p>There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.</p><p>NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.</p><ul><li>RAM - 4GB or Higher.</li><li>CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.</li><li>AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.</li><li>GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.</li><li>Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.</li><li>Price - Free.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925468/19272" target="_top" id="1925468">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925468" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925468/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording"><a href="#Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website.

You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.</p><p>Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg"                      alt="run shadowplay recorder"                ></p><p>Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z.

Performance and Requirements"></a>Part 3. Performance and Requirements</h2><p>There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software. This means no matter which screen recorder you use, there will always be some dip in the performance of the game, and you should learn to neglect it.</p><p>NVIDIA record gameplay software is compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. It is not compatible with Linux or macOS. Here is the list of system requirements for NVIDIA ShadowPlay.</p><ul><li>RAM - 4GB or Higher.</li><li>CPU - Intel Pentium G series, Intel Core i3 or higher.</li><li>AMD FX, Ryzen 3 and higher.</li><li>GPU - GeForce GTX 650 or Higher.</li><li>Driver - GeForce 430.64 or later.</li><li>Price - Free.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording-3"><a href="#Part-4-A-Better-Alternative-for-Screen-Recording-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Organizing footage and knowing exactly where a certain shot is in that sea of unsorted material will increase your efficiency during the post-production period, thus enabling you to shorten the amount of time you have to spend editing it.</p><p>Markers can be used during the video editing and after the screen recording to make post-production, to help you mark the places in the footage where you’ve made a mistake, where the new take starts or to indicate a spot on the timeline where you would like to place a particular video clip.

You won’t be able to see these markers until the video clip is imported into the software’s video editor and placed on the timeline.</p><p>You can use them to mark a place in the screen recording you’re not too happy with, or to highlight the part of the video clip that you intend on featuring in the final cut of the video you’ve created with Wondershare’s screen capturing and screen recording software. By doing so you’ll save time on going through all the material just to find a few seconds of footage that fit perfectly to your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-scrn-markers.jpg"                      alt="Filmora Scrn Markers"                ></p><p>The <strong>timeline markers</strong>, on the other hand, can only be added to a project once you’ve completed the recording session, during the post-production period. You can utilize them to highlight the parts of the video clip you want to remove from the final version of your video or to mark the spots on the timeline where you’d like to switch from one take to another.</p><p>This type of marker is immensely useful if you want to organize the timeline in your project better and to know exactly where every clip you want to use in your video is located at all times. Besides being a highly efficient tool for organizing vast amounts of footage, timeline markers can also help you denote the beats in the audio file and then sync the video clip perfectly to the beat of the tune you’re using as a soundtrack to your video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094428/7443" target="_top" id="2094428">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094428" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094428/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Add-Markers-During-Video-Editing-and-After-Screen-Recording-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?"></a>How to Add Markers During Video Editing and After Screen Recording in Filmora?</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><ul><li><a href="#filmora1">1.

In fact, it has become an equally popular platform among creators and brands as YouTube. That is why creators are willing to upload creative videos and go for live streaming to engage the audiences and get brand deals. You should live stream to Instagram from OBS Studio if you want to stream from your computer.</p><p>Instagram is primarily a mobile app and Instagrammers live stream from their smartphones. However, just like YouTube, you can live stream from your computer if the popular Instagrammers are doing these days. You need OBS Studio which is available for free and it is compatible with Windows, Mac and Linux.

You can live stream on almost any video streaming platform as long as you have the stream URL and stream key. On the other hand, Instagram only allows Instagram Live feature from its app. Therefore, you need a third-party app to obtain the stream URL and stream key so that you can connect OBS Studio with Instagram for live stream.</p><p>There are various third-party apps available to setup OBS Instagram live stream session. We recommend Streamon The application is also available for Windows, Mac and Linux users, just like OBS Studio. Before getting started, you should have the following ready.</p><ul><li>An Instagram account where you want to live stream from your computer.</li><li>Live streaming gadgets such as webcam, external microphone, lights as per your requirements.</li><li>Download and install Streamon as per your operating system.</li><li>Download and install OBS Studio on your computer.</li></ul><p>Here are the steps you have to take to setup OBS Instagram link to start live streaming.</p><p>Step 1: Open OBS Studio on your computer.</p><p>Step 2: Go to Profile&gt; New and name it as “OBS Studio Instagram live“.

Most Mac users never have the need to change this setting, because they can always move the file to a folder where they want to store it. On the other hand, creating a lot of screenshots every day can make a chaos on your desktop. Luckily changing the destination where your screenshots are saved is a simple process that lets you decide where your images will be stored.</p><p>Here’s how you can change the location where the screenshots you take using the keyboard shortcuts will be saved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Save-Screenshots-to-a-Specific-Folder-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac"></a>Part 1: How to Save Screenshots to a Specific Folder on Mac</h2><p>Changing the folder where you store your screenshots is not an irreversible process, which means that you can reset the destination where the files are saved to Desktop at any point. Do not delete the new folder, because your Mac may not be able to take screenshots, afterward. The process described below is the only way you can delete a folder or add a new destination for your screenshots, and failing to comply with it may cause your Mac to malfunction.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><p>Create a new folder on the desired location on your hard drive, and then launch Terminal, by typing Terminal in the Search Box and clicking on its icon. Once the app is open, you should insert the following command into the Terminal window:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location</strong></p><p>Then enter a space at the end after ‘location’.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mac-screenshot-terminal-settings.jpg"                      alt=" Mac Screenshots"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135375/19272" target="_top" id="2135375">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135375" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135375/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The next step is to add the new location at which screenshots will be saved and you can do this by simply dragging the folder you created into Terminal and adding it at the end of the command you just entered. A path is created and the command line should now contain the folder’s unique location and it should look like this:</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screencapture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;username&#x2F;Screenshots</strong></p><p>To execute the command you have to press Enter. After Terminal finishes running the command, its window will appear on the screen again. You should proceed to confirm the changes you’ve just made by resetting the User Interface on your computer. In order to do so, you’ll have to insert this command below the one you previously entered：</p><p><strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong></p><p>Hit Enter once more to confirm the changes and run the new command. Close Terminal app by clicking on the Terminal menu and selecting the Quick Terminal option. The default location where the screenshots are saved on your Mac is now changed and every time you take a screenshot using the Command + Shift + 3 shortcut the file will be saved at the new location. If for whatever reason you want to make the Desktop once again the destination where the screenshots on your computer will be saved here’s how you can do it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068417/7443" target="_top" id="2068417">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068417" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068417/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-the-Screenshot-Save-Location-Back-to-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop"></a>Part 2: How to Change the Screenshot Save Location Back to Desktop</h2><p>The process of changing the default screenshot save location back to Desktop is nearly identical to the process we just described. You just have to open the Terminal app and insert the following command into the prompt.</p><p><strong>defaults write com.apple.screen capture location &#x2F;Users&#x2F;Username&#x2F;Desktop&#x2F;</strong></p><p>Make sure that your username is properly written, and then press Enter to run the command. Now you only have to reset the UI so it can recognize the changes you’ve made, and you can do it by inserting the <strong>killall SystemUIServer</strong> command into the Terminal window and pressing Enter to execute it.</p><p>Don’t forget that deleting the folder you use as a default location for storing screenshots should only be done using the process we just described in the Terminal application, since all other methods may cause unnecessary trouble.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037358/7443" target="_top" id="2037358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037358/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-complete-investigation-into-razers-kiyo-webcam-for-2024/"><u>[New] Complete Investigation Into Razer's Kiyo Webcam for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-leveraging-the-strengths-of-ez-grabber-software-for-2024/"><u>[New] Leveraging the Strengths of EZ Grabber Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-mac-screenshot-strategy-revealed-for-2024/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Mac Screenshot Strategy Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-completely-erase-your-connection-with-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Completely Erase Your Connection with YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-decoding-the-best-free-video-apps-for-os-multiplicity-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Decoding the Best Free Video Apps for OS Multiplicity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-the-decision-to-adopt-itop-recording/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating the Decision to Adopt ITop Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-screen-sync-free-cross-platform-high-quality-recording-tools/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Screen Sync Free Cross-Platform, High-Quality Recording Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/2024-approved-androids-fastest-vid-tuning-tools-reviewed/"><u>2024 Approved Android's Fastest Vid Tuning Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-engaging-sims-4-gameplay-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Crafting Engaging Sims 4 Gameplay Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-excellent.techidaily.com/google-pc/"><u>Googleドライブの力: PC間でも簡単にファイルをリンクする技術</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/guide-to-mirror-your-tecno-spark-20-proplus-to-other-android-devices-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>Guide to Mirror Your Tecno Spark 20 Pro+ to Other Android devices | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-create-an-apple-developer-account-on-iphone-6-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Create an Apple Developer Account On iPhone 6 Plus</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimizing-color-depth-and-gradients-for-obs/"><u>In 2024, Optimizing Color Depth and Gradients for OBS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-premier-mac-recording-software-top-5-innovations-revealed/"><u>In 2024, Premier Mac Recording Software Top 5 Innovations Revealed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-things-you-should-know-when-unlocking-total-wireless-of-iphone-8-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Things You Should Know When Unlocking Total Wireless Of iPhone 8 Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/kindles-5-essential-selling-points-unveiled/"><u>Kindle's 5 Essential Selling Points Unveiled</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

This means you cannot open ShadowPlay directly, and you have to open it via GeForce Experience. Therefore, you need to have GeForce Experience installed on your phone. Apart from ShadowPlay, you get a direct game streaming option, instant game settings optimization and NVIDIA graphics card updates under GeForce Experience. Here are the steps to follow to use NVIDIA record screen software to record gameplay.</p><p>Step 1: Download and install GeForce Experience from NVIDIA official website.

This will open NVIDIA Share toolbar at the top of the screen.</p><p>Step 3: Along with NVIDIA Share toolbar, you will see ShadowPlay overlay UI. There are mainly three options - Instant Replay, Record, and Broadcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shadowplay-record.jpg"                      alt="shadowplay record button"                ></p><p>If you do not see the overlay containing recording options, click on the Share button at the left of the NVIDIA Share toolbar.</p><p>Step 4: Start the game whose gameplay you want to record. You will be asked to permit screen recording of the game.</p><p>Step 5: Turn on Instant Replay option to save epic moments during the gameplay. Finally, click on Record option and click on Start option to start recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/run-shadowplay-recorder.jpg"                      alt="run shadowplay recorder"                ></p><p>Step 6: During the gameplay, you can get back NVIDIA ShadowPlay overlay by pressing Alt + Z.

Performance and Requirements"></a>Part 3. Performance and Requirements</h2><p>There have been concerns raised by professional gamers that when you use NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or even broadcast gameplay live, it affects the performance of the game. After thorough experimentation, it has been found that running NVIDIA ShadowPlay to record gameplay or broadcast gameplay leads to the use of system resources. Therefore, there is a dip in the overall performance of the game of 5%-10%. Such a dip is negligible if you have a high-performance gaming computer.</p><p>However, the dip could be significant if your computer does not have a high configuration. In that case, the gameplay can get slightly slow and lag at times. In a fair comparison, NVIDIA GeForce recording may take slightly more system resources than most screen recording software.

This Android OS was released in 2013, and it is the first OS for Android Smartphones that enabled its users to create screen recordings, although only via the Android Developer SDK, with the help of Android Debug Bridge. Furthermore, this option only works if the device is connected to a computer, and you also need to have access to the phone’s Developer mode.</p><p>One year after the KitKat OS was introduced to the public Google developed a new version of the Android OS, popularly named Lolipop, which allowed users to record their Smartphone’s screen with an app. The name Lollipop refers to versions 5.0 and 5.1.1 of the Android OS, and in February 2018, 24,6% of all Android devices accessing Google Play had the Lollipop OS. The more recent versions of Android OS, like Android ‘Marshmallow’, also provide support for screen recording apps.</p><p>If you have Lollipop or Marshmallow OS installed on your Android Smartphone, you can use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rivulus.screenrecording&hl=en" >Lollipop Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app, although plenty more screen recording apps are available on the Google Play. Let’s have a look at the steps you’ll need to take in order to figure out how to record your screen on your Android phone with Lollipop Screen Recorder.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#Step-1-Download-and-install-Lollipop-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder"></a>Step 1  Download and install Lollipop Screen Recorder</h4><p>Open the Google Play application on your phone and search for the Lollipop Screen Recorder app. You can download it for free, so after the installation of the app is complete, launch it and proceed to adjust the settings for your screen recording session.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings"><a href="#Step-2-Fine-tuning-the-settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings"></a>Step 2 Fine-tuning the settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Lollipop Screen Recorder features only three settings, that let you choose whether you want to shoot in Landscape or Portrait mode, change the resolution of the video recording and enable the audio recording feature.</p><p>It is important to pay attention to the size of the file you are producing, especially if you want to send it to someone because if you pick the maximum Recording Resolution, the video file of your screen recording is going to be huge. Tutorials in which you show how an app is used or how to fix a certain problem on an Android Phone can benefit from the Record Microphone Audio option because it will enable you to explain the steps with your voice.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device"><a href="#Step-3-Recording-the-screen-of-an-Android-device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device"></a>Step 3  Recording the screen of an Android device</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-start-recording.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Now that you’ve adjusted all the settings for a screen recording session, you should click on the circular icon located in the upper right corner of the app.</p><p>After you tap on the icon a message will pop up on the screen informing you that the app is about to start a new screen recording session. Check the Don’t show again checkbox and proceed to tap on the Start Now button. Once the screen recording session is in progress, you can leave the Lollipop Screen Recorder app and perform all activities you wanted to capture with your Android Smartphone.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session"><a href="#Step-4-Finishing-the-recording-session" class="headerlink" title="Step 4  Finishing the recording session"></a>Step 4  Finishing the recording session</h4><p>The app’s notification bar is going to be located at the top of the Smartphone’s screen, during the screen recording session, so in order to stop recording you simply need to find the notification with the label ‘Recording Screen’ and press stop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lollipop-screen-recorder-recorded-file.jpg"                      alt=" Lollipop Screen Recorder "                ></p><p>Go back to the Lollipop Screen Recorder and you’ll be able to find the video file in the app’s main window. You can play the video directly from the Lollipop Screen recorder or you can share it to your Gmail account directly from the app. If you don’t like the screen recording you made, you can tap on the Delete button and start a new session.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Amazingly easy to use and it lets you capture videos in Portrait and Landscape modes.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Lollipop Screen Recorder can only capture screens in the device’s native resolution, and it doesn’t provide any customization options.</p><p><em><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Find out more video recorders for Android Phones and Tablets <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049370/7443" target="_top" id="2049370">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049370" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049370/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen"><a href="#Part-2-Connecting-Your-Android-Devices-to-Windows-PC-or-Mac-to-Capture-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen"></a>Part 2: Connecting Your Android Devices to Windows PC or Mac to Capture Screen</h2><p>Using an app to record the screen of your Android smartphone is just one method in which this task can be accomplished. Let’s have a look at a few other methods that can also be used to record an Android Smartphone screen.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Capture-your-Android-screen-with-ADB"><a href="#Method-1-Capture-your-Android-screen-with-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Capture your Android screen with ADB"></a>Method 1: Capture your Android screen with ADB</h3><p>This option is great in the event of app doesn’t work for you. Android SDK are available to download from <a class="link"   href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" >Android developer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This feature allows you to record video via USB with the bundled Android Debug Bridge. To use this feature, your device should run on Android 4.4 or later.</p><p>Android Debug Bridge is a command-line utility that can control your Android Smartphone from a computer, copy files and add or remove apps. However, if you want to use ADB you’ll first need to go through the setup process, and even add it to the Windows System PATH.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB"><a href="#Step-1-Enabling-the-ADB" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enabling the ADB"></a>Step 1: Enabling the ADB</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-screen-via-computer.jpg"                      alt=" Record Android Screen via Computer"                ></p><p>Locate the SDK’s installation folder on your PC, and click on the ADB option in the Platform Tools menu.

That doesn’t necessarily mean that you can’t record video with older android devices.<br>In such cases you can use android SDK to mirror the device’s display and record it using a desktop screen-capture software. Mirroring Software will enable you to record the screen on an Android device without rooting. You can use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/android-screen-mirror/" >Wondershare MirrorGo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> software to mirror cast the screen from your mobile phone to a display on your computer.

Launch the software and connect your Android Smartphone to the MirrorGo. You’ll be able to see the screen of your Android device on the PC’s screen. The software will synchronize all actions between two displays.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Record-the-Screen"><a href="#Step-2-Record-the-Screen" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Record the Screen"></a>Step 2: Record the Screen</h4><p>Locate the Android Recorder button, and click on it to commence the screen recording session.

Although they are frequently used to capture the gameplay of a video game, capture cards can also be used to capture a screen on an Android Smartphone.</p><p>These external video adapters let you connect the Android device and a computer, although you’ll have to spend some time to properly set up a screen recording session with a capture card. Some capture cards can cost as much as $200, so if you want to utilize this method to capture a screen on your Android Smartphone you should be prepared to invest money in such a project.</p><p>But the cost is the only downside of this otherwise very effective method of recording a screen on an Android device. The amount of options capture cards offer is staggering, but before you start recording a screen on your Smartphone you must make sure that you have the right hardware and software equipment.</p><p>What if this also doesn’t work for you? Don’t give up. You still stand a chance if your android device has an HDMI port. You can connect your device to a digital video camera and do the recording. Failing this, your solution will depend on a PC with HDMI PCI Express card or a USB HDMI adaptor powered with a suitable video capture software.</p><p>Sometimes you shouldn’t depend on installing apps. With the help of a ROM flasher, you can get a screen recorded included in your devices ROM. Therefore, if you already have a custom ROM running on your device, better to have a look if a screen recorder is installed. If so, it is a matter of activating it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144310/7443" target="_top" id="2144310">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144310" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144310/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-setting-up-your-logitech-webcam-for-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Setting Up Your Logitech Webcam for Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-finns-fiscal-flow-income-insights-from-youtube-icon/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Finn's Fiscal Flow Income Insights From YouTube Icon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-broadcasting-showdown-deciding-between-obs-and-twitch-studio/"><u>[Updated] Broadcasting Showdown Deciding Between OBS and Twitch Studio</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-revolutionize-playtime-win11s-game-library/"><u>[Updated] Revolutionize Playtime Win11's Game Library</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/ace-virtual-imagery-ideal-google-meet-screens-for-2024/"><u>Ace Virtual Imagery Ideal Google Meet Screens for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/battlefield-2042-tips-to-eliminate-frame-rate-drops-and-stutters-for-optimal-pc-gaming-performance/"><u>Battlefield 2042 - Tips to Eliminate Frame Rate Drops & Stutters for Optimal PC Gaming Performance</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/editorial-essentials-film-fragments-for-cutting/"><u>Editorial Essentials Film Fragments for Cutting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/free-creativity-unleashed-bings-dall-e-3-explained/"><u>Free Creativity Unleashed: Bing's DALL-E 3 Explained</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/gratuitamente-converti-gli-file-oma-in-formato-mp3-con-movavi-esegui-la-conversione-on-line/"><u>Gratuitamente Converti Gli File OMA in Formato MP3 Con Movavi - Esegui La Conversione On-Line</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-photos-from-android-gallery-after-format-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-by-stellar-photo-recovery-android-mobile-photo-recover/"><u>How to recover deleted photos from Android Gallery after format on Samsung Galaxy F15 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-effortless-gameplay-capture-a-compreayers-approach-to-xbox-recording/"><u>In 2024, Effortless Gameplay Capture A Compreayer's Approach to Xbox Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/legacy-linkup-software-for-2024/"><u>Legacy Linkup Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/professionalscreenx-insiders-take-on-software-for-2024/"><u>ProfessionalScreenX Insider’s Take on Software for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/review-and-compare-streamlabs-and-embedding-platforms-for-2024/"><u>Review and Compare StreamLabs & Embedding Platforms for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The MMO industry generates 10 billion dollars a year and reaches audiences much larger than that. You can find plenty of both free MMORPG games and paid MMORPG’s. World of Warcraft, for example, has players who have cumulatively spent more time on Azeroth than the human species has existed on this planet for 6 million years. The underlying idea behind all these big numbers is a simple one: anyone, anywhere, can become anything in this virtual world (and grind out some loot along the way).</p><p>Unlike the text-based multi-user dungeons from which MMOs evolved, today’s MMOs are incredibly sophisticated. These games offer the best of the genre, be it as humanoid cats or as ruthless dictators. We’ve rounded up the best online games you can play today to celebrate that awesome lineage—and help you find the one that is worth your time. To make things simpler, we’ve also categorized them to give you a good idea of what makes each game exceptional. Also, we will share a list of free MMORPG games, so you don’t need to worry about paying anything to play these games.</p><p> You can check <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Clicker Games to Kill time&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="1-World-of-Warcraft"><a href="#1-World-of-Warcraft" class="headerlink" title="1. World of Warcraft"></a><strong>1. World of Warcraft</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Understandably, you may think the world of Warcraft isn’t a free MMORPG. So why is it listed? You can play the first 20 levels of the game for free, and since 20 levels mean a lot of time in World of Warcraft, you should have no problem playing it all. It is for this reason that it has been included on this list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/world-of-warcraft-poster.jpg"                      alt="world-of-warcraft-poster"                ></p><p>There are not many people who are unfamiliar with the world of Warcraft. It’s a game that’s synonymous with the MMORPG genre. It offers players an expansive, ever-expanding universe filled with content to discover. All the elements of a quality MMORPG are present in this game, such as character customization, a persistent open world, and a compelling storyline. Getting started with World of Warcraft should be your top priority if you haven’t done so already. A game like this shouldn’t be missed.</p><h4 id="2-Guild-Wars-2"><a href="#2-Guild-Wars-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Guild Wars 2"></a><strong>2. Guild Wars 2</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Another free MMORPG for beginners to start with, Guild Wars 2, has an interesting storyline that changes based on your decisions. You won’t find that in other games of its kind. As with most other MMORPGs, the game includes general features like character customization, crafting, and strong PvP and PvP elements.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/guild-wars-2-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>It takes place in the fantasy world of Tyria and lets players explore a vast persistent world alone or with friends. As part of Guild Wars 2’s story, there are also a number of instanced environments that players will encounter. Guild Wars 2’s dynamic action-based mechanic makes leveling up far more enjoyable than World of Warcraft, which is sometimes considered a grind. If you’re tired of the monotony of leveling up in other MMORPGs, this game is for you.</p><h4 id="3-Secret-Worlds-Legends"><a href="#3-Secret-Worlds-Legends" class="headerlink" title="3. Secret Worlds Legends"></a><strong>3. Secret Worlds Legends</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Secret World Legends is another recent convert to the free-to-play model. The game is defined at least partly by its setting, which is the stuff of conspiracy theory crackpots’ dreams (or their worst nightmares). A world shrouded in mystery and filled with supernatural horrors is characterized by secret societies, mythological creatures, and evil cults. This game’s events are given a dramatic sweeping sweep by some killer sound design, which effectively amps up the tension.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/secret-worlds-legends-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>The game’s dedication to storytelling is one of its strongest features. Instead of the standard MMO trope of allowing players to queue up an out-of-control number of quests with no sense of overarching purpose, the Secret World focuses on a small number of quests at a time with clearly defined goals. The game’s narrative is emphasized by narrowing the focus, and its writing and atmosphere are showcased, which is of a fairly uniform high quality.</p><h4 id="4-Star-Conflict"><a href="#4-Star-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Star Conflict"></a><strong>4. Star Conflict</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms</strong>: Windows, Xbox One</p><p>Try Star Conflict if you like space exploration. The free MMORPG puts you in the role of a space pilot seeking out alien treasures scattered all over its expansive universe. During Star Conflict, you are tasked with collecting various spaceships, for example, fighters or massive satellites that you can float in space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-conflict-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There are a variety of PvE quests and raids in the game, where you have to fight alien squadrons and space pirates and PvP while floating around in outer space in your spaceship. You can also customize your spaceship using various weapon types or ship modules organized under a tech tree. Another great feature of Star Conflict is that it allows players to experience the game in virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><h4 id="5-Skyforge"><a href="#5-Skyforge" class="headerlink" title="5. Skyforge"></a><strong>5. Skyforge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows</p><p>Throughout your apotheosis, you become a god, gaining followers, and ascending to godhood in a sci-fi world fully equipped with advanced technology. That’s true, all those words do not typically go together, but let’s not give up just yet. When you can make your own god in Skyforge, why be a mere minion in a vast world filled with other loot-grinders?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skyforge-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Unlike many typical MMOs, Skyforge offers players the ability to change their class at any time, so matchmaking is smooth and level progression is no longer necessary. In the prestige system, characters are ranked according to their general stats rather than by leveling up. Skyforge offers a nice diversion from other MMO’s grind by changing traditional MMO systems, offering a fascinating sci-fi world, and offering action-oriented combat.</p><h4 id="6-DC-Universe-Online"><a href="#6-DC-Universe-Online" class="headerlink" title="6. DC Universe Online"></a><strong>6. DC Universe Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox One</p><p>DC Universe Online, an online MMORPG with custom abilities, offers the opportunity to build your own superhero and play with well-known heroes from the DC multiverse, such as Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman, among others.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dc-universe-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>In addition to its unique combat tab-targeting system which makes it stand out from other games on this list, it also makes the game more user-friendly for players. As well as having a captivating storyline, cool gear to collect, and levels that allow players to choose how they want to progress in the game, DC Universe Online offers many other features that will appeal to gamers.</p><h4 id="7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online"><a href="#7-Lord-of-the-Rings-Online" class="headerlink" title="7. Lord of the Rings Online"></a><strong>7. Lord of the Rings Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>The Lord of the Rings Online is an MMORPG based in the impeccably detailed LOTR universe that is perfect for fans of medieval fantasy and Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. With the game, players go on a journey across Middle Earth, fighting alongside familiar characters and exploring locations such as those in the movies.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lord-of-the-rings-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>There is just one small exception to the gameplay of Lord of the Rings Online, but it’s no different than any other MMORPG on this list. There are no large scale PvP opportunities in LOTR Online, since all characters in the game are on the same side. It instead provides players with a Monster Play mode that allows them to create a monster at level ten and battle other players within Ettenmoor.</p><h4 id="8-Star-Trek-Online"><a href="#8-Star-Trek-Online" class="headerlink" title="8. Star Trek Online"></a><strong>8. Star Trek Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC</p><p>In addition to its solid license, Star Trek Online offers a rich and unique gameplay experience that is unbeatable in the MMO market. With its spaceships and aliens, and a consistent blend of third-person shooter and naval simulator, Space Truckers Online is an addictive game that will keep you hooked with its spaceships and aliens.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/star-trek-online-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Many familiar elements are found in the series and films that are as enjoyable to discover as they sound. Fan service is done right in Star Trek: The Original Series by blowing up borg cubes, strolling Deep Space Nine’s promenade, or beaming down to exotic planets as part of an away team. A new story expansion on the Alpha Quadrant, launching at the end of January, offers new gameplay content set in a previously unexplored sector, as well as a number of recent limited-time events and minigames.</p><h4 id="9-ArcheAge"><a href="#9-ArcheAge" class="headerlink" title="9. ArcheAge"></a><strong>9. ArcheAge</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>You can do pretty much anything in ArcheAge, a medieval fantasy game that takes you to a medieval fantasy world. If you want to be a powerful warrior, you can do so with a huge sword of your own and a big group of friends at your side, or you can become an economics expert and take on the challenges of farming and trade. As a pirate, you can rob traders and plunder their goods.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/archeage-poster.jpg"                      alt=" Convert WebP to JPG"                ></p><p>Additionally, Mounts and Travel play an important role in ArcheAge. On top of riding wild animals such as lions and deer across its colossal world, you can also take to the air and sea. You can sail the oceans in anything from rowboats to warships, and there are also aerial modes of transportation like gliders and airships. Archeage shows how dedicated Trion is (and the resources that they have available to them) in its polish and longevity.</p><h4 id="10-EVE-Online"><a href="#10-EVE-Online" class="headerlink" title="10. EVE Online"></a><strong>10. EVE Online</strong></h4><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>EVE Online is still the premier space MMO, and it has been the source of many memorable gaming stories, owing to the way it focuses on a few elements and excels at them. As well as meticulous simulations and systems, CCP pays attention to its dedicated community and responds appropriately, as it is often their subscribers who make the decisions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eve-online-poster.jpg"                      alt="eve-online-poster"                ></p><p>Although detractors dismiss EVE as spreadsheets in space, the criticism highlights one of its strongest points: its real and thriving economy.
