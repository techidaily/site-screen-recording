Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.everwebinar.com/1t60/" >EverWebinar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars.

This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-1"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives.

Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-1"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits-1"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations-1"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task.

Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-1"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software-1"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing-1"><a href="#4-Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-1"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems-1"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-1"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-1"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts-1"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-1"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-1" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-1"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-1"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar-1"><a href="#5-EverWebinar-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-2"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-2"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives.

Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-2"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis.

Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations-2"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly.

Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-2"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software-2"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing-2"><a href="#4-Pricing-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-2"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-2"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-2" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional.

Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-2"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-2"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available.

Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-2"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-2"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-2"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar.

In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail.

Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering.

Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-3"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-3"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live?

The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-3"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation.

Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available.

Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-3"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-3"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-3"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam can be used for a wide array of different purposes including, Q&amp;As, presenting products or chatting with your fans.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress.

Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar-3"><a href="#5-EverWebinar-3" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.everwebinar.com/1t60/" >EverWebinar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars. Small and up-and-coming brands that can profit from replaying webinars that were already recorded, will find EverWebinar’s services perfectly optimized for this task.</p><p>You can schedule a new rebroadcasting session effortlessly and simulate the look and feel of the original webinar while increasing the user engagement by making the videos available for a limited amount of time. This process is automated, so you can focus on chatting with the webinar’s participants or work on other projects while the On-demand webinar is in progress. EverWebinar lets you create three types of webinars, live, hybrid and automated, and you just have to select the option that best fits your current needs.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Password protected webinar rooms, great metrics features and interactive displays that present your products and services to the audience.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a professional level of marketeering skills</p><h4 id="6-GoToWebinar-3"><a href="#6-GoToWebinar-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars. GoToWebinar enables you to record your webinars and share them on YouTube or the GoToStage, an in-house video sharing platform that has millions of visitors.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Equally efficient at creating live and On-Demand webinars, high-end analytics tools, great for raising the brand awareness</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The video files captured with GoToWebinar are stored on a computer, and they have to be uploaded manually on a desired video sharing platform, much more expensive than its competitors.</p><h4 id="7-Zoom-3"><a href="#7-Zoom-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Zoom"></a>7. <a class="link"   href="https://zoom.us/" >Zoom <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Educators, large companies, marketing teams</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> The Basic version is free, the Pro version costs $14,99 per month</p><p>This is a versatile webinar platform that is equally effective when utilized by eLearning content creators, entrepreneurs or marketers.

Regardless of the plan you purchase, the number of interactive participants will be limited to one hundred, but you’ll be able to have an audience that includes as many as 10.000 people, even though they won’t be able to interact with the content you’re presenting.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, and equipped with powerful tools for creating and recording a webinar</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Group meetings can’t last longer than 40 minutes, and the Zoom’s interface takes some time to get used to.</p><h4 id="8-Livestorm-3"><a href="#8-Livestorm-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Livestorm"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://livestorm.co/" >Livestorm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Analytics oriented marketers</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing starts at $99 per month for Starter package</p><p>The greatest advantage Livestorm has over its competitors are the high-end analytics tools that provide the users with actionable insights.

The webinar software stores all content on its servers, but it can also be used with other platforms that provide streaming services, such as Twitch or YouTube. However, the basic version of Livestorm doesn’t allow you to have more than a hundred attendees per webinar.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Unique analytics tools that enable you to track minute-by-minute attendance or attention rates</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive and the Starter package offers a limited amount of webinar tools and features</p><h4 id="9-ClikMeeting-3"><a href="#9-ClikMeeting-3" class="headerlink" title="9.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives. Education and promotion are the most common reason to produce a webinar, so here are a few ideas that can help you choose the subject of your first webinar:</p><h4 id="1-Tutorial-Webinar"><a href="#1-Tutorial-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="1. Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task. You should do everything in your power to approach this task prepared since a simple mistake can ruin a lot of work.</p><h4 id="1-Define-Your-Goals"><a href="#1-Define-Your-Goals" class="headerlink" title="1. Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience"><a href="#2-Target-Audience" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing"><a href="#4-Pricing" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing. Besides powerful tools for measuring metrics a good webinar software should also offer social media integrations, so you can reach even more people who might be interested in what your webinars have to offer.</p><h4 id="3-Interactivity"><a href="#3-Interactivity" class="headerlink" title="3. Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam"><a href="#4-WebinarJam" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar"><a href="#5-EverWebinar" class="headerlink" title="5. EverWebinar"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.everwebinar.com/1t60/" >EverWebinar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars.

This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-1"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives.

Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-1"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis. You can use a webcam, a screen recorder or any type of camera to teach others how to use apps, software or any other modern technology.</p><h4 id="3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits-1"><a href="#3-Reviews-and-Website-Audits-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations-1"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly. Even the high-end professionals encounter problems while using a software, which means that your audience can include inexperienced and skilled users.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-5-Aspects-Worth-Considering-Before-Choosing-the-Best-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software"></a>Part 5: Aspects Worth Considering Before Choosing the Best Webinar Software</h2><p>The decision to start producing webinars shouldn’t be taken lightly, because creating a successful webinar is anything but an easy task.

Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-1"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software-1"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing-1"><a href="#4-Pricing-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-1"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-1"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-1" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional. The webinar software that doesn’t provide a rich selection of content authoring tools may limit your possibilities and reduce the maximum reach a webinar can have.</p><h4 id="2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems-1"><a href="#2-Integrations-and-Engagement-Tracking-Systems-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-1"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-1"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available. That’s the reason why we’ve put together the list of the ten best webinar software products, so let’s dive in and explore the premier options for bloggers, entrepreneurs and everyone else who wants to create webinars.</p><table><thead><tr><th>App Name</th><th>Best For</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Platform</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Google + Hangouts</td><td>Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube Live</td><td>Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</td><td>Free</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook Live</td><td>Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</td><td>Free</td><td>iOS, Android</td></tr><tr><td>WebinarJam</td><td>Selling products during a webinar, live chat with participants of a webinar</td><td>$39,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>EverWebinar</td><td>On-Demand Webinars</td><td>$41 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GoToWebinar</td><td>Large marketing teams</td><td>Plans start at $89</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Zoom</td><td>Educators, large companies, marketing teams</td><td>$14,99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>Livestorm</td><td>Analytics oriented marketers</td><td>$99 per month</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>ClickMeeting</td><td>In-company meetings, all types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $25</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr><tr><td>GetResponse</td><td>All types of webinars</td><td>Pricing plans start at $49</td><td>Web-based, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h4 id="1-Google-Hangouts-1"><a href="#1-Google-Hangouts-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-1"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-1" class="headerlink" title="2. YouTube Live"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/my%5Flive%5Fevents" >YouTube Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Entrepreneurs who are learning how to create a webinar</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>YouTube is the largest online video sharing platform in the world that offers most of its services for free. The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-1"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Facebook Live"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.facebook.com/livestream/" >Facebook Live <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Establishing a better bond with an existing audience on Facebook</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>Facebook, like many popular social media networks, has integrated live streaming into the services it provides. Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-1"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress. This and countless other options make WebinarJam platform a perfect tool for marketing teams. Some pricing plans offer you to have up to 3 webinars per month that have five hundred participants, while the content sharing capabilities are nothing short of impressive regardless of the pricing plan you choose.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Makes engaging the audience look easy through a rich selection of powerful tools that enable you to interact with viewers of your webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Pricey, and novice users may experience a steep learning curve</p><h4 id="5-EverWebinar-1"><a href="#5-EverWebinar-1" class="headerlink" title="5.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar. This process may sound daunting at first, but with time and experience, you’ll come to realize why most online marketers think that webinars are the second most effective b2b marketing strategy.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-a-Webinar-Work-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does a Webinar Work?</h2><p>A web-based seminar is run by a presenter, a person who provides information relevant to the webinar’s topic to attendees. In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail. Once the session is over, all participants of a webinar receive a video recording so they can rewatch it or go through the parts of the session they’ve missed.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-2"><a href="#Part-3-What-is-a-Webinar-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?"></a>Part 3: What is a Webinar Software?</h2><p>Besides the hardware, you will also need the proper software to set up your first webinar. Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering. However, the key ingredient of any powerful webinar software are the metrics tools that let you monitor user engagement and other statistics that are important to the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-2"><a href="#Part-4-4-Types-of-Webinars-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars"></a>Part 4: 4 Types of Webinars</h2><p>On-demand and live webinars can cover a wide range of topics that have different objectives.

Tutorial Webinar"></a>1. Tutorial Webinar</h4><p>This is probably the most popular type of a webinar because tutorials help people solve problems and accomplish things they struggled with. Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-2"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Tech Training Webinar"></a>2. Tech Training Webinar</h4><p>Technology and software are developing at an astounding rate, so most of us are having trouble to keep up with all the latest apps and software products that emerge on the market almost on a daily basis.

Reviews and Website Audits"></a>3. Reviews and Website Audits</h4><p>A lot of small brands and companies are struggling when it comes to online presentation, which is the reason why creating a webinar that offers in-depth analysis of their blog, website or sales page can prove to be very useful to the participants of your webinars. What’s more, you can offer constructive critique of almost anything, as long as it is relevant to the target group you’re addressing.</p><h4 id="4-Software-Demonstrations-2"><a href="#4-Software-Demonstrations-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Software Demonstrations"></a>4. Software Demonstrations</h4><p>Companies that manufacture software as well as individuals who consider themselves experts for a particular software can create webinars that demonstrate how a computer program is used properly.

Define Your Goals"></a>1. Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-2"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live? These are some of the questions that might help you define your target audience and adjust the content of your webinar to the level of skills and knowledge an ideal participant of your webinar has. Knowing who your audience is, will also help you establish a stronger bond with the attendees of the webinars you are producing.</p><h4 id="3-Choose-the-Right-Software-2"><a href="#3-Choose-the-Right-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Choose the Right Software"></a>3. Choose the Right Software</h4><p>The type of webinar you want to create will point you in the direction of the best webinar software for the job. Simple online applications like Google + Hangouts or Facebook Live can be a perfect solution if you’re looking for an efficient and easy way to broadcast your content live, but if you are more interested in the production of On-Demand webinars then Zoom or GoToWebinar platforms are a much better choice for you.</p><h4 id="4-Pricing-2"><a href="#4-Pricing-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Pricing"></a>4. Pricing</h4><p>Most professional webinar software are expensive, and if you have no intention of using the advanced features they offer, then there is no reason to invest in them. However, if you want to sell products, draw on the screen during a webinar or keep track of the user engagement statistics for each webinar you produce, investing in the right webinar software may prove to be essential for the success of your webinars.</p><h2 id="Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-2"><a href="#Part-6-What-Makes-a-Good-Webinar-Software-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?"></a>Part 6: What Makes a Good Webinar Software?</h2><p>There are a lot of factors that should be taken into consideration when trying to determine whether or not the webinar software meets the industry standards. A good webinar software offers features that make the process of creating a webinar smooth while enabling you to focus on the quality of the content you’re producing. Here are a few options that make a webinar software great.</p><h4 id="1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-2"><a href="#1-The-Content-Authoring-Tools-2" class="headerlink" title="1. The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional.

Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems"></a>2. Integrations and Engagement Tracking Systems</h4><p>Numbers matter. A scientific approach to webinars will enable you to stay ahead of the competition and to keep track of how well your content is performing.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-2"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-2" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation. The information we provided above should help you find the right webinar software that will enable you to produce visual content of the highest quality.</p><h2 id="Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-2"><a href="#Part-7-10-Best-Free-and-Commercial-Software-Products-for-Webinars-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars"></a>Part 7: 10 Best Free and Commercial Software Products for Webinars</h2><p>Staying ahead of your competition and keeping pace with all the latest technology trends is essential if your goal is to conquer new markets or to lead teams that have great chemistry. Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available.

Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-2"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-2" class="headerlink" title="2.

The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-2"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-2" class="headerlink" title="3.

Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-2"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-2" class="headerlink" title="4.

Most events are broadcasted live, although On-Demand webinars or Evergreen webinars as they are sometimes referred to, allow you to use the existing material and simulate the live broadcast experience.</p><p>Live meetings online in which a single person or several speakers discuss, present or demonstrate a certain topic, information or a product are called webinars. The audience of a webinar varies from a single person up to 5.000 people depending on the purpose and the software that is being used for the production of a webinar.

In order to record a webinar, you’ll need a computer that is equipped with a webcam, a pair of headphones and a microphone, or you can use a Smartphone as an alternative. Most webinar software products offer tools that enable the presenter to insert all types of documents, draw on the screen and use other methods of explaining the topic to the viewers.</p><p>Participants can ask questions, post comments or even speak during a webinar if they are granted permission, and the presenter can answer questions or explain some aspects of the topic in more detail.

Even though live streaming is possible without the use of software products that are optimized for webinar creation, most computer programs for production of webinars offer powerful tools that broaden the range of things you can do while broadcasting.</p><p>A well-rounded webinar software enables you to set up a registration page, chat with participants or use pop-up windows that allow attendees to purchase the products or services you’re offering.

Your webinars can show viewers how they can perform color grading on their videos, build a dog house for their children or make a delicious ice cream, the options are unlimited. The only prerequisite is to be really good at what you are explaining, since talking about topics you don’t know much about, can hardly lead you to success.</p><h4 id="2-Tech-Training-Webinar-3"><a href="#2-Tech-Training-Webinar-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Define Your Goals</h4><p>Being successful requires you to know your goals, so before you start producing webinars you have to define what you want to accomplish and work on it patiently. Masterclasses, One-On-One sessions in which you share your expertise or customer training webinars can all be on the list of your objectives, but you should only make webinars that are directly related to your area of expertise.</p><h4 id="2-Target-Audience-3"><a href="#2-Target-Audience-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Target Audience"></a>2. Target Audience</h4><p>Who is your ideal webinar attendee? How old is this person, and where do they live?

The Content Authoring Tools"></a>1. The Content Authoring Tools</h4><p>Setting up webinar registration pages, chatting with the participants of your webinar or selling products during a webinar are just a few among many authoring tools you will need to make your presentations look professional.

Interactivity"></a>3. Interactivity</h4><p>Being able to communicate with your audience, through live chat or video messages and to respond to each question they might have will improve your chances to make a sale or to develop a loyal fan-base that follows each of your webinars. Some webinar hosting platforms allow you to have more than just one speaker, so webinar attendees can share their opinions and feel more involved in the discussion that is taking place.</p><h4 id="4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-3"><a href="#4-Branding-or-White-Labeling-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Branding or White Labeling"></a>4. Branding or White Labeling</h4><p>A good webinar software should help you raise brand awareness. You should be able to add logos to everything you offer through your webinars, use the brand’s colors or even include the brand’s promo materials in a webinar. Customizing webinars will help you fans recognize your work, but putting too much accent on the promotion of your brand can come across as too aggressive, so it is important to find the right measure in branding and white labeling.</p><p>Creating webinars is not a complicated process, but it does require preparation.

Only a few decades ago, it was impossible to hold a conference video call that included more than thirty people, while online training courses were regarded as science fiction. The Internet, webcams, and screen capturing software have changed all this, and today we can easily produce software walk-throughs, eLearning content and a wide variety of video content that enables us to establish strong relationships with potential clients.</p><p>Choosing the webinar software that is capable of meeting all of your demands might be more challenging than it seems because there are thousands of webinar software products available.

Google + Hangouts"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://hangouts.google.com/" >Google + Hangouts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate communication and non-commercial webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>The Google’s product lets you invite as many as thirty participants to a webinar, and if you want, you can also broadcast the webinar on YouTube Stream. All broadcasting sessions are recorded and stored on the YouTube channel you used to broadcast a webinar, and the owner of the channel can make the video private or public. However, the Google + Hangouts app has gone through a lot of changes over the last few years, and on March 9, 2017, Google has announced that it will divide Hangouts into two products, Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet.</p><p>Companies that employ large numbers of people often use Google + Hangouts because it enables more than one participant of the webinar to speak and because new members can easily join the webinar. This app isn’t perfectly suited for commercial use since it doesn’t allow you to set a fee for joining the event.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> A great tool for webinars that have a lot of participants, especially if there are several speakers. The app lets you upload webinars to YouTube and share them effortlessly.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Creating paid events or keeping track of the metrics is not on the list of options Google + Hangouts offers, and you need to create an account on Google before you can join a webinar.</p><h4 id="2-YouTube-Live-3"><a href="#2-YouTube-Live-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

The YouTube Live feature enables its users to stream live footage captured with screen recording software or webcams and to invite as many viewers to their webinars as they want. Anyone who has a link can join the broadcast, but replying to messages and comments viewers post during a webinar is needlessly complicated.</p><p>Besides, making communication with the participants of a webinar almost impossible, YouTube Live also doesn’t feature a lot of marketing tools that can boost the sales of the products you’re offering. To make things even worse, your broadcasts may have a lag that can be as long as 40 seconds, so paying attention to how you set up your webinars can be crucial for their success.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Easy to use and enables even the most inexperienced vloggers, eLearning content creators, and marketers to produce and share webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Limited interaction with viewers as well as the lack of advanced features for marketing products make YouTube Live only suitable for newcomers to the world of webinars.</p><h4 id="3-Facebook-Live-3"><a href="#3-Facebook-Live-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Besides enabling you to create webinars, Facebook Live also lets its users produce any other type of live stream, but only with a Smartphone. The conventional webcam method of recording webinars is not available on Facebook Live, and the app doesn’t offer any features for customization of webinars.</p><p>The number of people watching your live stream cannot surpass the number of friends you have on your Facebook account, which means that you can’t use this app to reach new clients. However, if you have a loyal fan-base on this social network, Facebook Live can help you develop a better relationship with people who already follow your work. Even though creating webinars with Facebook Live is possible, professionals will be better off using some more powerful webinar software.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Anyone who has a Facebook account can install and use Facebook Live for free, to capture handheld footage for their webinars.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> No other features besides the live streaming option and you can’t record webinars with a webcam.</p><h4 id="4-WebinarJam-3"><a href="#4-WebinarJam-3" class="headerlink" title="4.

WebinarJam can be used for a wide array of different purposes including, Q&amp;As, presenting products or chatting with your fans.

WebinarJam also provides features such as pop-ups that let you sell products and services while the webinar is in progress.

EverWebinar"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://www.everwebinar.com/1t60/" >EverWebinar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> On-demand Webinars</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> $41 per month, billed annually</p><p>WebinarJam and EverWebinar were developed by the same team, although the two platforms offer somewhat different options. The EverWebinar is designed to facilitate and simplify the process of rebroadcasting On-demand webinars. Small and up-and-coming brands that can profit from replaying webinars that were already recorded, will find EverWebinar’s services perfectly optimized for this task.</p><p>You can schedule a new rebroadcasting session effortlessly and simulate the look and feel of the original webinar while increasing the user engagement by making the videos available for a limited amount of time. This process is automated, so you can focus on chatting with the webinar’s participants or work on other projects while the On-demand webinar is in progress. EverWebinar lets you create three types of webinars, live, hybrid and automated, and you just have to select the option that best fits your current needs.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Password protected webinar rooms, great metrics features and interactive displays that present your products and services to the audience.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires a professional level of marketeering skills</p><h4 id="6-GoToWebinar-3"><a href="#6-GoToWebinar-3" class="headerlink" title="6.

This amazing webinar tool lets you create live events, produce interactive On-demand webinars or host events that include up to 5000 participants. Surveying the audience of a webinar and adding interactive polls or Q&amp;As is also an option you’ll have at your disposal if you decide to produce your webinars with GoToWebinar.</p><p>The online platform grants you access to advanced metrics so you can monitor how well your content is performing, which allows you to get leads and all other data you need to extend the reach of your webinars.

Regardless of the plan you purchase, the number of interactive participants will be limited to one hundred, but you’ll be able to have an audience that includes as many as 10.000 people, even though they won’t be able to interact with the content you’re presenting.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Affordable, and equipped with powerful tools for creating and recording a webinar</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Group meetings can’t last longer than 40 minutes, and the Zoom’s interface takes some time to get used to.</p><h4 id="8-Livestorm-3"><a href="#8-Livestorm-3" class="headerlink" title="8.Livestorm"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://livestorm.co/" >Livestorm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Best for:</strong> Analytics oriented marketers</p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, pricing starts at $99 per month for Starter package</p><p>The greatest advantage Livestorm has over its competitors are the high-end analytics tools that provide the users with actionable insights.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Comparing-Recording-Quality-The-Pros-Cons-of-30Fps-and-60Fps"><a href="#Comparing-Recording-Quality-The-Pros-Cons-of-30Fps-and-60Fps" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Recording Quality: The Pros &amp; Cons of 30Fps and 60Fps"></a>Comparing Recording Quality: The Pros &amp; Cons of 30Fps and 60Fps</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos. There is no shortage of screen recording tools online to help you get your videos to the ideal frame rate.</p><p>We understand if you feel lost and wonder which tool best suits your needs. In our opinion, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best editing tools you could have in your arsenal. The Screen Recorder feature on this platform is exquisite, allowing you to record anything you do on your screen effortlessly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Wondershare Filmora also supports screen + webcam recording since the developers understand that videos with a speaker are more engaging than if you only recorded a voiceover. As you play a game, review a product, host an online meeting or record a tutorial, you can record video and audio of yourself using the webcam.</p><p>Another exciting perk of using this screen recorder feature is that you don’t need to display your entire screen. You can customize your recording area and set the platform to capture a target window within specific dimensions.</p><p>Below is a detailed guide on how to use Wondershare Filmora to record your screen.</p><p>Step 1 Go to the homepage on the browser and install the desktop app on your device. Once the installation is complete, click “File” and then select “Record Media” on the drop-down menu.

As you play a game, review a product, host an online meeting or record a tutorial, you can record video and audio of yourself using the webcam.</p><p>Another exciting perk of using this screen recorder feature is that you don’t need to display your entire screen. You can customize your recording area and set the platform to capture a target window within specific dimensions.</p><p>Below is a detailed guide on how to use Wondershare Filmora to record your screen.</p><p>Step 1 Go to the homepage on the browser and install the desktop app on your device. Once the installation is complete, click “File” and then select “Record Media” on the drop-down menu. You can then choose whether to record a voiceover, record your PC screen, or from your webcam.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-record-pc-screen-2.jpg"                      alt="wondershare filmora record media"                ></p><p>Step 2 Customize your screen recording using the tools in the platform.

To get things started, the pre-requisites are the newest version of OBS Studio, Zoom, and one of the numerous plugins that offer a virtual camera.

You can also obtain separate files for gallery view and full-sized speaker view if you record to the Zoom cloud. Yet, many individuals are adopting choices, such as Open Broadcaster Software, or OBS, to record video meetings. When utilizing OBS to record and manage your Zoom meetings, you can obtain higher-resolution video and audio.

If you want to record Zoom meetings and preserve them for later, you may obtain amazing results without any third-party software. The only things you’ll need to install are OBS and Zoom The video will have a brief time when Zoom is not in full-screen, and the cascading preview will appear if the OBS is on the same display. You may delete it in post-editing if required. The sound in the recording will be doubled if you’re using speakers since your mic will take up the output sound from your device. Use headphones to prevent this.

The outcome is subsequently streamed live to your streaming platforms of choice, such as YouTube or Twitch, and&#x2F;or to a recorder.</p><p>Part 2. <a href="#part2">Record Roblox Games with Filmora</a></p><p>Part 3. <a href="#part3">Record Roblox with Windows Game Bar</a></p><h5 id="Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1"><a href="#Filmora-Screen-Recorder-1" class="headerlink" title="Filmora Screen Recorder"></a><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>Record screen on PC and Mac with webcam</p><p>Capture system amd micorphone audio simultaneously</p><p>Edit video and audio with built-in tools</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Connect-OBS-to-Zoom-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam"></a>Part 3. Comparison of OBS vs Bandicam</h2><p>Here is a detailed comparison of OBS Studio and Bandicam that will definitely help you to which video recording software you should opt for.</p><p><strong>Interface:</strong></p><p>The user interface is the main difference between the two popular recording applications. The user interface of OBS can be too overwhelming for a beginner. It takes considerable time to get used to and find the required options instantly. In fact, you may have to go through tutorial videos to get a proper grip on the software. Owning to the popularity of OBS Studio, there is no dearth of videos and guides on OBS.</p><p>On the contrary, Bandicam has a straightforward and user-friendly interface. This is one of the main reasons why some users ditch OBS and opt for Bandicam by paying the required price. You can get all the options intuitively and adjust all the parameters of video recording instantly. Even a beginner will feel like a pro while using Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Screen Recording:</strong></p><p>Both the applications are tailor-made for screen recording. In terms of settings and customizing parameters, both the applications have the same offering. However, when it comes to customized screen recording such as capturing a portion of the screen, the operation gets easy with Bandicam thanks to its intuitive controls and options.</p><p>Moreover, there are more options available for better screen recording on Bandicam. The mouse clicks are well highlighted, there are options for real-time drawing, and you can even schedule screen recording. Setting up a webcam along with the screen in addition to system and external audio recording is more convenient on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Game Recording</strong>:</p><p>There is a dedicated option available on Bandicam for game recording. This means setting up your screen and recording parameters is easy on Bandicam when it comes to game recording. On the contrary, there is no dedicated option on OBS and hence, it is the same as recording your screen with OBS. Therefore, in terms of options and easy controls for game recording, Bandicam is a clear winner.</p><p>However, for recording high-end games, you need a considerably high configuration computer for Bandicam. Otherwise, it brings down FPS automatically so that the system does not break down while recording. Besides, for advanced game recording, OBS supports multi-screen recording which is not available on Bandicam.</p><p><strong>Live Streaming</strong>:</p><p>Bandicam is a purely video recording software. There is no option available on Bandicam for live streaming on any platform. Therefore, if you are looking for a video recorder where you can live stream as well, Bandicam should not be your choice and you have to opt for OBS Studio.</p><p>OBS Studio is equally popular in the video creator community as a video recorder as well as a live streaming platform. It is hardly as software available like OBS from where you can live stream on so many different online platforms. Once you have the stream URL and stream key, you are good to go for live streaming from your desktop computer.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Screen-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.
