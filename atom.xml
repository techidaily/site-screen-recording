How to Record Video with Streamlabs"></a>2. How to Record Video with Streamlabs</h2><p>It’s good to know that Streamlabs has a few choices to play with if you’re using a graphics card encoder. Try Recording if you don’t require a lot of quality, and if it doesn’t enough, you can always move up to High-Quality Recording. Consider the size of the files before using Indistinguishable or Near-Lossless Recording if you require high-quality recordings. Many of the other settings on the Recording panel have to do with bitrate when you go to Advanced. As part of your recording setup, this is essentially the greater the bitrate, the bigger the file size of the video. To avoid pixelated video, it is best to keep the bitrate at a reasonable level. So beginning with the Streamlabs OBS download for pc, here’s a detailed step-by-step guide for you.</p><h2 id="Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS"><a href="#Step-1-Install-and-Launch-Streamlabs-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS"></a>Step 1: Install and Launch Streamlabs OBS</h2><p>The method of installation is really simple. It’s a one-of-a-kind experience. Streamlabs OBS has to be installed first. Streamlabs OBS pre-configures everything for you and takes you right to your dashboard after you’ve finished the Windows installation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamlabs.jpg"                      alt="streamlabs"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings"><a href="#Step-2-Setup-the-Recording-and-Streaming-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings"></a>Step 2: Setup the Recording and Streaming Settings</h2><p>The next step is to personalize the settings and link your Twitch or YouTube account to the device. By selecting ‘Login’ in the upper right-hand corner of Streamlabs OBS, you may sign in to your Twitch or YouTube account. Run the Auto Optimizer by going to Settings &gt; General.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/streamingsettings.jpg"                      alt="streamsettings"                ></p><h2 id="Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly"><a href="#Step-3-Save-or-Share-Directly" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Save or Share Directly"></a>Step 3: Save or Share Directly</h2><p>A few clicks and the ‘starting soon’ or ‘facial cam and video game’ scenes are already in place. The next step is to enter your stream key so that Streamlabs OBS may upload your material to the platform for viewing by other subscribers. Click Settings &gt; Stream &gt; and then input your stream key to do this. In the lower right-hand corner, click “Go Live” to begin streaming. If you’re encoding with x264, you’ll have to enter these values by hand. The best bitrate depends on your screen size and set-up, so there isn’t a universal setting that works for everyone. When recording at 60 frames per second in 1080p, you can start with 40,000kbps and adjust as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-or-share.jpg"                      alt="save or share"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151856/7443" target="_top" id="2151856">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151856" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151856/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen"><a href="#3-Alternative-Way-to-Record-Computer-Screen" class="headerlink" title="3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen"></a>3. Alternative Way to Record Computer Screen</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, there’s a difference between OBS and Streamlabs OBS – Streamlabs, such as chat windows and a dashboard, are included. The Streamlabs OBS helps you keep track of your donations and fans. With pre-made themes and templates, it is also easier to incorporate them in a live stream. Non-Streamlabs versions of OBS still support OBS templates, themes, and overlays. But due to its lacking of various features, there’s an alternative to it namely Wondershare Filmora. Both streaming and real-time recording are possible with Filmora screen recorder, which produces HD video quality and is easy to use. Thus, the study explains how to record YouTube videos and how to view them online.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Step-1-Get-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Get-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Get the Software"></a>Step 1: Get the Software</h2><p>As an option, you can record the screen in high-definition (HD). The first step in setting up Wondershare Filmora is to download it from the company’s website and then run the setup file that is downloaded. Once it has been installed, you can run it from your computer. To begin recording, you must click the “Record Mode” menu after the software has been launched. As a result, a new screen will be displayed. In this section, you’ll need to select the area of your computer that you want to record. You can change the recording area’s size by dragging the dotted red color bar, or you can manually enter the screen’s dimensions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-mode.jpg"                      alt="record mode"                ></p><h2 id="Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-the-Recording-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode"></a>Step 2: Enter the Recording Mode</h2><p>A camera attached to your computer will automatically be detected and begin recording your activities as soon as you finish the installation. If you want to record part of the screen to use in your tutorial, you can do so in a variety of ways, including by selecting a specific area of the screen to record. Both webcam and screen captures are supported by Filmora. If you prefer, you can take advantage of an external camera. This feature is bolstered by the ability to select your preferred video recording resolution while you are filming.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enter-the-recording-mode.jpg"                      alt="enter the recording mode"                ></p><p>It’s like when recording video, by default, the system’s audio is recorded, but this can be disabled. The built-in microphone can also be used, as well as an external microphone. For example, in gameplay videos, the audio-visuals of the game are just as important as the player’s reaction to the game. In addition, live streaming and online tutorials have become increasingly popular.</p><h2 id="Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region"><a href="#Steps3-Set-Audio-Screen-Recording-Region" class="headerlink" title="Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region"></a>Steps3: Set Audio&#x2F;Screen Recording Region</h2><p>You can now quickly and easily record audio for the video that was created with the screenshot using Wondershare Filmora (or the camera recording). An external microphone or the computer’s built-in recording system can be used for this. You can learn how to quickly and easily add your comments to the top of the page by watching the video below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/set-audio.jpg"                      alt="set audio"                ></p><p>All of this has to do with video in some way. It is possible to edit, mute, and add music and voiceovers to the soundtrack that contains your recordings at the bottom of the screen.</p><h2 id="Step-4-Editing-Your-Recorded-Video"><a href="#Step-4-Editing-Your-Recorded-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Editing Your Recorded Video"></a>Step 4: Editing Your Recorded Video</h2><p>The idea of putting a small screen above an instructional or video recording and allowing viewers to leave comments is another intriguing one. This is a simple way to record your thoughts about the game or the subject matter you’re currently studying, and it doesn’t require much effort.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/editing.jpg"                      alt="editing"                ></p><p>Pushing the button starts the recording process.
