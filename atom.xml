Whether it’s an engineer, graphical designer, or programmer, he will prefer Linux-based operating systems and computers. Therefore, Macbook Air computers since 2008 are commonly used by information technology geeks. Nowadays, this trend has not been limited to its professional users but everyone in our circle wants to buy a cool Macbook despite its use.</p><p>Well, in this scenario using the graphical GUI might seem easy but it’s not pretty basic to that of windows. Many of us want to capture our screen either for educational purposes or entertainment but doing that on Macbook might not be so simple. However, you don’t need to panic because we have got you all covered in this article. We will see how to screen record on MacBook Air using different techniques. So let’s begin one by one in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-1-Use-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 1: Use Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>MacBook Air OS supports certain keyboard shortcuts to start screen recording and taking screenshots. You can either take a screenshot using the shortcut keys or record your screen by bringing in the tools on the screen To bring the screen recording tools menu on Mac, all you need is to press “Command + Shift + 4”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-air-os-use-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg"                      alt="macbook air os use keyboard shortcuts"                ></p><p>After pressing you will be prompted to application windows as shown in the figure.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-recorder-settings.jpg"                      alt="macbook recorder settings"                ></p><p>Once the application window appears, you must know what each icon on the window means. On the left side of the window, as you can see, you can manage the screenshot of your screen either in full or of some windows or areas. Next is the middle area, which gives you two modes for screen recording, fullscreen mode to record your screen or choose a certain area to record from the screen as shown above in the figure. You can access all the recording settings before pressing to record your screen.</p><p>**<strong>Recording Settings:</strong></p><p>Before starting your screen recording it’s important to adjust for different recording settings as shown in the figure below. Just click the “options” in the main GUI of the recorder to show it up.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-click-the-options.jpg"                      alt="macbook click the options"                ></p><p>You can select your destination folder for saving your records using the “save to” bar in the settings. Set the timer up to 5 and 10 seconds if you short version video. You can also set to record both visual and audio from the screen using the microphone settings.

These are the options you can adjust before starting your screen record.</p><p>To stop recording all you have to do is press the small icon that appears in the top-right corner of your desktop screen. Visit your selected destination folder of the recording and bingo you can enjoy your screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/macbook-stop-recording.jpg"                      alt="macbook stop recording"                ></p><p>**<strong>Other Shortcut Keys:</strong></p><p>Other shortcut keys that can be used to take screenshots and screen recording let’s have a look at the following table.</p><table><thead><tr><th>**<strong>Shortcut Key</strong></th><th>**<strong>Function</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shift + Command + 3</td><td>Take a Full Screenshot.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4</td><td>Capturing a portion of the screen</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 4 + Spacebar</td><td>Take a screenshot of a certain window.</td></tr><tr><td>Shift + Command + 5</td><td>Bring you the screenshot and screen recording tools</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#Part-2-Use-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Use QuickTime Player"></a>Part 2: Use QuickTime Player</h2><p>Another hidden application in your MacBook Air utility program that already comes built-in with Mac OS is QuickTime Player.

The entire world of Minecraft is based on squares and cubes. Minecraft allows you to create amazing buildings, homes, and a kingdom. To make your buildings unique and different you can add different elements and shapes in your buildings such as circles, spheres, and curves. Circle and spheres are used as decorating materials and can be very helpful in creating different things and buildings. It seems impossible to build circles and spheres using cubes. You can create a circle and sphere easily by following simple steps. If you ever look at an image of a circle after zooming in, you will notice small pixels in the form of squares that are held together to create a circle. We can use such a technique to create a circle and sphere using cubic blocks in Minecraft. We can create pixelated circles and spheres without any curves. In this article, we will illustrate how to make a circle in Minecraft and how to make a sphere in Minecraft separately.</p><hr><h2 id="How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide"><a href="#How-to-make-a-circle-in-Minecraft-A-Step-by-Step-Guide" class="headerlink" title="How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide"></a>How to make a circle in Minecraft: A Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you have ever noticed that when we zoom in out images, small pixels are held together to form a perfect image. We have to apply the same method here. We have to take these cubes as pixels and connect them with each other for a complete picture to form a circle.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> The first step of how to make a circle in Minecraft is to decide the circumference of the circle you want to create. In this example, we are going to create a circle with a circumference of 17 blocks. You can choose any circumference depending upon the size of the circle you want. Place 17 blocks in a series to make a straight line. Now at the 9th block, which is the middle of the line, place two blocks perpendicular blocks on both sides of the line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle1"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now add 7 blocks on each side of the line to make a plus ‘+’ sign. It will create a circumference of the circle by both the x-axis and y-axis.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle2"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> At the edges of each line create a perpendicular line of 5 blocks each. This will create an outer boundary of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle3"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now to complete the outer boundary of the circle, you have to add two blocks in the same direction of the outer line of the circle. But this time come a little bit closer to the center of the circle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle4.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle4"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Complete the outer by adding an ‘L’ shaped structure created with 3 blocks on each of the four sides of the circle to complete the outer boundary.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle5.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle5"                ></p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since the outer of the circle is complete, now you can either remove the center lines of the circle to make it hollow or fill it with the blocks to make it a complete filled circle and make it a place where you can stand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-circle6.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-circle6"                ></p><hr><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://estore.zonealarm.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=38658749&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://sc1.checkpoint.com/sc1/za/images/boxes/pa_500.png"                      border="0"                >ZoneAlarm Pro Antivirus + Firewall NextGen</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft"><a href="#How-to-make-a-Sphere-in-Minecraft" class="headerlink" title="How to make a Sphere in Minecraft"></a>How to make a Sphere in Minecraft</h2><p>The only difference between making a circle and a sphere is the difference in dimensions. The circle is Two Dimensional and the sphere is three-dimensional. It is not as difficult as it seems.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To get started, create a tall column of the block according to the size of the sphere that you want to make. In this example, we are going to form a 16 blocks long column. You can change it according to your requirement.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere1.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere1"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now it’s time to create layers of the sphere. To do that you have to create a layer of 7 blocks wide on the top and the bottom of the column.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere2.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere2"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.emeditor.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4631722&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.emeditor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/frontpage2-2048x588.webp"                      border="0"                >EmEditor Professional (Lifetime License, non-store app)</a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Since you have created the 1st and the 16th levels of the sphere, now you have to follow this procedure for all remaining layers: Make a layer of 11 blocks for the 2nd and 15th levels.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/minecraft-make-sphere3.jpg"                      alt="minecraft-make-sphere3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://electronicx.pxf.io/c/5597632/1872496/14483" target="_top" id="1872496"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14483-1872496"                      border="0" alt="" width="750" height="625"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1872496/14483"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Follow the same pattern throughout the levels: 13 blocks layer on 3rd and 14th level, 15 blocks on 4th and 13th levels, 17 blocks on 5th and 12th level, and so on. As you can notice that each new level comes with 2 extra blocks.

Unlike other media players, QuickTime Player is not just for playing audio and video files. The application can record the screen on Mac and save the recordings on the hard drive. Therefore, there is no need for any third-party screen recorder for basic recording. However, many users have reported that they <strong>cannot stop QuickTime screen recording</strong> following the standard procedure.</p><p>When the application fails to stop recording, it fails to save the recording as well. Therefore, QuickTime Player keeps recording the screen, and this slows down the Mac as it keeps occupying the system resources. In this article, we will illustrate all the possible ways to QuickTime Player stop screen recording.

Half-Life 2 is a tremendously ambitious game that benefits from being created by a much more confident valve.</p><p>Everything is larger this time around than in 1998: the settings, the adversaries, the narrative - it’s a blockbuster but a smart one.

Not only are there over 60 weapons in Escape from Tarkov, but each one may be modified or stripped down to the point of being unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents. For each ammunition type, you may change barrels, mounts, scopes, flashlights, foregrips, pistol grips, handguards, muzzle attachments, stocks, charging handles, magazines, receivers, and gas blocks as well as select from a variety of cartridge kinds. These reasons are enough for this game to make a place in the best Fps games.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p>• Realistic modeling.</p><p>• Unrecognizable from its off-the-shelf equivalents.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4737285&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/b2f83c409ce63012229fb9cd465bdcfe/products/copy_reporting_system.png"                      border="0"                >  KoolReport Pro  is an advanced solution for creating data reports and dashboards in PHP.

You may use them to produce comprehensive recordings as well as recordings that are limited to a single component or window. The disadvantage is that the free versions of this software sometimes include some very inconvenient restrictions, such as a relatively short time usage or bearing of those annoying presence of watermarks, which might negatively affect the result somewhat.</p><p>We introduce you to an amazing recording software RecordCast by PearlMountain company to record your screen and webcams online. It is a web-based application designed to capture your screen, webcam, and microphone input data. The interface to use the application is very user-friendly. Moreover, it provides free usage capability of up to 5 minutes of maximum recording time. However, for longer recordings, you might need to upgrade them. Let’s have a detailed review of the RecordCast in the coming sections.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-1-Key-Features-of-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast"></a>Part 1: Key Features of RecordCast</h2><p>Software is best analyzed by the features it has to offer. The RecordCast is equipped with amazing features that you can avail of directly online through the web. Let’s discuss these features one by one to explore them for your ease.</p><p>**<strong>Free and User-Friendly</strong></p><p>The first and the foremost prevalent perk of a RecordCast is its free usage for its users. The application provides you to sign in free of cost to avail of its recording capabilities without any watermark issues. Moreover, the GUI of the web-based application is very easy to use that only needs a few steps to do the job.</p><p>**<strong>Multiple Recording Modes:</strong></p><p>With the 3 recording modes of the RecordCast, it leads all other similar software which usually has single recording modes. The three recording modes let you choose to record webcam + screen simultaneously or one at a time.</p><p>**<strong>All-in-One:</strong></p><p>The RecordCast is not only designed to record screens but with its video editing tools, you can now edit, trim, change colors, apply filters and put artistic effects on any video online. This amazing feature makes it a competitor for video editor tools too.</p><p>**<strong>Protected:</strong></p><p>With great care for privacy and security, RecordCast stores and edit your video or recordings locally. It doesn’t upload your content to the web servers instead, it never shares your content with any third party.</p><p>**<strong>Fair Pricing:</strong></p><p>The free version of RecordCast let you record a screen or webcam for a maximum of 5 minutes. However, it can be upgraded to its premium version so you can avail all its features by only paying 2.99 $ per month. This is very fair considering other similar software pricing.</p><p>**<strong>Compatibility:</strong></p><p>Due to the online nature of the RecordCast, it is compatible with any computer. Whether it is a Mac or Windows, you will not have to set up any compatibility settings before using it. This gives it an edge over other similar software.</p><p>**<strong>No Storage:</strong></p><p>Normally, you need to download an application and then install it for its usage. However, in the case of RecordCast, you save a considerable amount of storage by not installing it on your PC.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-RecordCast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use RecordCast"></a>Part 2: How to Use RecordCast</h2><p>With the three RecordCast, you can record your screen or webcam, download it and edit it the way you like to online.
