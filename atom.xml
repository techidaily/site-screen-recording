In the past, <strong>recording internal audio</strong> in Android is severely restricted by Google. However, KitKat version of Android OS has finally enabled Android Smartphone users to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record the screens <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on their devices, but recording the clear and perfect internal audio is not an easy job because of the Android OS policy that screen recording apps are not given the permission to record the internal sound of the Android phone or tablet after Android Lollipop version, recording the internal sound through microphone is a solution. Still, it picks up background noise while screen capturing is in progress.</p><p>So, how to create an internal audio recording on your Android devices? While in this article, I will show you 4 different ways in the following 3 Parts to record your gameplay video with internal audio recording on Android phones or tablets without root.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</a></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/logo_icon/wondershare-filmora-logo-horizontal.png"                      alt="Filmora logo"                > <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/common/filmora-product-banner.png"                      alt="filmora product interface"                ></p><h3 id="The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor"><a href="#The-All-in-One-Screen-Recorder-Video-Editor" class="headerlink" title="The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor"></a>The All-in-One Screen Recorder &amp; Video Editor</h3><ul><li>Record desktop screen, voiceover, and webcam simultaneously</li><li>Edit recorded clips quickly with a wide range of professional tools</li><li>Built-in plentiful templates and effects</li><li>Export to MP4, MOV, MKV, GIF and multiple formats</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/common/securety.svg"                      alt="secure download"                >Secure Download</p><hr><h2 id="Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps"><a href="#Part-1-Record-system-internal-audio-with-Android-screen-recording-apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps"></a>Part 1: Record system internal audio with Android screen recording apps</h2><p>For a long time, the only way to record the internal audio with an Android Smartphone was through the device’s external microphone. This method of recording audio had many downsides, including poor audio quality and capturing of distracting background noises.</p><p>There are several different ways in which you can record system audio and avoid producing screen recordings with terrible sound. Each of the methods includes using third-party apps or screen capturing devices, since Android Lollipop and later versions of the Android OS, still don’t offer an effective solution to this problem.</p><h3 id="1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android"><a href="#1-Use-Mobizen-Screen-Recorder-with-Internal-Audio-App-to-Record-the-internal-audio-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android"></a>1. Use Mobizen Screen Recorder with Internal Audio App to Record the internal audio on Android</h3><p>Recently, RSUPPORT company developed the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rsupport.mvagent" >Mobizen Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app that is equipped with all the essential screen recording tools. At the same time, it also allows its users to record only sound produced by their Smartphones during the screen recording session. You can download this app for free on the Google Play store, but if you choose to install it on your Android phone, you should arm yourself with patience since this app contains ads.</p><p>After you’ve successfully installed Mobizen Screen Recorder on your Android Smartphone, you should launch the app and look for the Settings gear icon located in the upper right corner of your screen. Tap on the Sound option, and before proceeding any further, you should make sure that Sound is enabled. Once you allow the Sound feature, you’ll be able to see the Options menu that offers External and Internal features. By selecting the Internal option, you will instruct the app to record only the sound produced by the gameplay of the video game you are recording or a YouTube video you’re playing while the screen recording session is in progress.</p><p>The result you will get is the crystal clear audio in your screen recording, but Mobizen app performs well <strong>only with Samsung and LG Android phones</strong>, so if you have an Android device from some other manufacturer, this app may underperform.</p><h3 id="2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder"><a href="#2-Record-the-internal-audio-from-a-microphone-on-Android-with-the-AZ-Screen-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder"></a>2. Record the internal audio from a microphone on Android with the AZ Screen Recorder</h3><p>If you choose to utilize this method of recording internal audio, make sure that the room where your recording is completely silent since the microphone you will be using can pick up external sounds as well as internal audio.</p><p>You can download the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecorat.screenrecorder.free&hl=en" >AZ Screen Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the Google Play for free. Once the installation is complete, launch the app and tap on the Settings icon. This app won’t record sound until you enable this option, which is the reason why you should locate the Record Audio feature in the Settings menu.</p><p>At this point, you should exit the app, and click on the AZ bubble on the side of your Smartphone’s screen. Tap on the Record icon to start the screen recording session and proceed to perform all actions you wanted to capture with your Android device. The audio will be recorded simultaneously with the video. When ready, slide down the notification bar, and stop the screen recording session.</p><p>In order to extract the audio file, you’ll have to transfer the screen recording you made with AZ Screen Recorder to a PC and perform this action with a video editing software. You may have to create several screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen before you get the perfect audio because the device’s microphone is going to capture all sound it can pick up, both external and internal.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card"><a href="#Part-2-Record-Android-internal-audio-with-a-capture-card" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card"></a>Part 2: Record Android internal audio with a capture card</h2><p>Capture cards are much more than screen recorders since they mostly serve as a bridge between a PC and the device whose screen you are trying to capture. Professionals often use capture cards, despite their prices, simply because they enable them to record high-quality screen recordings, create live streams, and record internal audio from any device they are connected to, including Android Smartphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-capture-card.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC with capture card"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043597/7443" target="_top" id="2043597">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043597" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043597/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Most capture cards are equipped with their own screen recording software, so the process of adjusting the video and audio settings depends on the capture card you have. If you have an <a class="link"   href="https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/downloads" >Elgato <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Capture Card you can have complete control over the audio recording process by using the Elgato Sound Capture feature. This powerful tool will enable you to mix sounds from multiple sources, select which microphones will be used during a live stream and adjust the music and sound volumes. However, if you want to use the Elgato, you need to make sure that your PC is compatible with this capture card, and you’ll have to connect your Android Smartphone with this device.</p><p>Using capture cards to record a screen on your Smartphone may be too expensive since capture cards are frequently used as a part of the professional gaming equipment used for streaming or capturing gameplay from games on Xbox or PS4.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983545">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983545">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983545.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983545%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983545/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator"><a href="#Part-3-Record-Android-Internal-Audio-with-Bandicam-and-the-Nox-Emulator" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator"></a>Part 3: Record Android Internal Audio with Bandicam and the Nox Emulator</h2><p>Although this may not be the simplest way to record internal audio on your Smartphone device, it is probably the best solution if you want to create high-resolution screen recordings of your Smartphone’s screen and professional internal audio recordings at the same time.</p><p>Before you can start a recording session you must first install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Bandicam <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on your PC. This software can be used for the production of high-quality screen recordings of your desktop, and it also offers excellent audio recording options.</p><p>Furthermore, you are going to need an Android emulator, an app that sends the pictures from your Android’s screen to a bigger screen, connected to your Android device. The <a class="link"   href="https://www.bignox.com/" >Nox App Player <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will enable you to run the apps you want to record on your PC. There is a recording feature in the NOxPlayer Emulator, while the Bandicam software can be used to capture your desktop activities, as well as the system audio during a screen recording session. So, it is recommended to use both Bandicam and NoxPlayer to record audio in the video from Android phone on PC.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-android-games-pc-noxplayer.jpg"                      alt="Record Android games on PC"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770526">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770526">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770526.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770526%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770526/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This method of recording internal audio on an Android device is best used if you want to create high-resolution audio recordings that can later be edited and used in the final cut of the screen recording you produced with Bandicam software and the Nox App Player.</p><p>That’s the way that we figured out about how to record the internal sound on your Android phones and tablets.

When coupled with the current coronavirus situation, working from home is vital. When we are using our own tech to work remotely – what is the best video conference app to use? Great question! Let’s find out.</p><h2 id="The-Best-Video-Conference-App-For-Android-And-iPhone"><a href="#The-Best-Video-Conference-App-For-Android-And-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="The Best Video Conference App For Android And iPhone"></a>The Best Video Conference App For Android And iPhone</h2><h3 id="1-Microsoft-Teams"><a href="#1-Microsoft-Teams" class="headerlink" title="1.

It has been explicitly made with sharing in mind. It also comes with file sharing, business conferencing, and full integration with Office 365. Arguably the best virtual meeting app overall, Microsoft Teams offers both versatility and performance.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Very high compatibility, cross-device, cross-OS communications.</li><li>If you get 365, this comes at no additional charge—integration of everything Microsoft.</li><li>File backups are made when you transfer. They are also fully searchable.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It is high on storage.</li><li>Channel limit set at 100. Go past it with a single team, and you will need to start deleting data.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130532/26400" target="_top" id="2130532">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130532" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130532/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Zoom-Cloud-Meetings"><a href="#2-Zoom-Cloud-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="2.

With fantastic HD quality in both audio and video departments, Zoom has earned a place among the top apps recently downloaded, overall. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >record Zoom meeting <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if necessary. If you don’t use Zoom Cloud and still want to record the meeting sessions, you can use some <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Zooming Meeting Record Apps for iOS and Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to record.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Syncs with your calendar <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to allow <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >scheduling <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, inviting, and canceling with ease. Easy joining, too.</li><li>Cross-device compatibility lets you use it on your desktop, phone, or tablet – anywhere you like.</li><li>You can record or annotate your meetings. There is even an option to transcribe your speech, which you can later search back.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Can reach 100% of your phone performance while you use it.</li><li>If you have an old Android, then just run it on your laptop.</li></ul><h3 id="3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings"><a href="#3-ezTalks-Video-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="3. ezTalks Video Meetings"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eztalks-video-meetings/id1109287539" >ezTalks Video Meetings <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/eztalks-app.JPG"                      alt="ezTalks Video Meetings"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Both Android and iOS, as well as browser, Mac, and Windows.</p><p>Third on our list is ezTalks Video Meetings. Again, high compatibility across devices earns it a right place on the list of the best conferencing apps. In terms of file sharing and screen sharing, ezTalks goes above and beyond the call of duty to bring you a seamless video conferencing service.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Gallery sharing, screen sharing, file sharing, and whiteboard facility.</li><li>No install can answer on either your phone or your browser, easy to join.</li><li>They are ergonomically designed to work with a patchy phone signal and not charge you extra for location.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>It’s not as well known as it should be.</li><li>Again, it is high on storage. We doubt any of the top video conferencing apps take anything less than 75% of your processing power.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Cisco-Webex-Meetings"><a href="#4-Cisco-Webex-Meetings" class="headerlink" title="4.

They have been doing their best to provide the masses with a virtual presence for years now. Cisco meetings have all the usual audio and visual features – but they specialize in providing a secure platform from which to conduct business. This stable platform is what makes them the best video conferencing app for business, in our eyes.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>It is a very secure system, which incorporates both audio and visual meetings of high quality.</li><li>Whiteboard and screen sharing capabilities.</li><li>It works from most high-tech cars. Toyota SDL car support comes as standard.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>There are compatibility flaws between whiteboard use and iOS in some cases.</li><li>Screen widget for Webex is only available for Android users.</li></ul><h3 id="5-Skype-for-Business"><a href="#5-Skype-for-Business" class="headerlink" title="5. Skype for Business"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.lync15&hl=en_US" >Skype for Business <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/skype-app.JPG"                      alt="Skype for Business"                ></p><p>Supported Platform: Works across all devices and are very, very proud of it!</p><p>We love that the initial video meeting app has now developed a new arm, specifically for companies. Skype for Business allows you to keep in touch with remote workers with a few short clicks. One of the best features of Skype is that they have been around for a long time. They have video calling down to a fine art. Second best? It is a unified communications platform that integrates with just about everything you will ever need. You can also <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >share screen on Skype <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with others.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Maximum compatibility – laptop, tablet, iPhone, Android – Skype for Business works with everything.</li><li>It can be used with Outlook and fully integrates everything Microsoft.</li><li>Very easy to learn user interface with options for training and various helpful features. Things like translation allows it to be the best video conferencing app for business – or at least up in the top three.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Audio and Video tends to stutter and glitch.</li><li>Uses all your phone processing power to keep it going.</li></ul><h3 id="6-GoToMeeting"><a href="#6-GoToMeeting" class="headerlink" title="6.

You could, feasibly, use this service to make a pitch or presentation. It’s highly scalable, too, so it can be used across large or small businesses.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Aside from calls – you can have one-on-one while you are in a big meeting. Allows you to remind people on the fly.</li><li>It is a great conference video call app that comes with screen sharing and even remote screen contributions.</li><li>Easy to use, join, and negotiate.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Reviewers have reported poor error reporting with little fixes.</li><li>In some areas, it is too sensitive for those running meetings.</li></ul><h3 id="7-Google-Hangouts-Meet"><a href="#7-Google-Hangouts-Meet" class="headerlink" title="7.

Although it is a great video meeting app, we would opt for a specifically designed business app if we were looking for a work conference suite. On the upside, everyone has a Google account and knows how to use it. They also give unrivaled integration and quality of calls.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Fantastic clarity of audio and visual calling with loads of options for addons.</li><li>Sign in with your Google account, great integration across their range of products.</li><li>Meet with webinar-style gatherings, perfect video meeting app for students or education.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>Some features are specific to G Suite customers.</li><li>Although aimed at business users, they get low reviews because it should be a social tool.</li></ul><h3 id="8-Slack"><a href="#8-Slack" class="headerlink" title="8.

It’s not that we would use it as a conference call video app, it’s more that we prefer to use it to catch up on office gossip, do daily check-ins, or give progress reports. What we’re saying is that it is an excellent in-house communications tool. We think there are better inter-office tools for making the best virtual meeting apps.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>A friendly place to chat during business hours that allows you to check on remote workers.</li><li>There is a certain amount of personalization between workers accounts.</li><li>Think of it as a virtual workplace like an office space in the virtual world.

Learn all the essential elements and steps to record voice over like professionals.</p><p>For every video you come across, the audio part is equally important as the visual part. Even when the visual part is top-notch, if the audio part such as background music and the voice narration is not good enough, you lose interest in the video. Therefore, you have to pay equal attention to the video recording as well as voiceover recording. A voiceover is basically a person speaking in the background as the video is playing along to make proper sense as well as to add more context to the video.</p><p>A voiceover recording can be describing the video, explaining concepts, highlighting important points, and likewise. Generally, a voiceover is added to the video after the video is already recorded. In order to record a good voice over, there are certain essential elements you need to have beforehand. In this article, we will explain why and how to record a voice over and how to make a voice over good to get everyone’s attention and appreciation.</p><h2 id="1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover"><a href="#1-Why-To-Record-A-Voiceover" class="headerlink" title="1. Why To Record A Voiceover?"></a>1. Why To Record A Voiceover?</h2><p>The engagement on a video depends both on how good the video content as well as how good the audio is. The audio in a video is not just about background music. A good voiceover can do wonders in terms of retaining the attention of the viewers as well as showcasing your personality traits.</p><p>A voice over recording is a must when you are making instructional, educational, and informational videos. Imagine watching a tutorial video where there is no voice to explain what is happening on the screen, everyone will leave the video immediately. Therefore, a voiceover essentially explains the video so that everyone can understand and even relate properly.</p><h2 id="2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over"><a href="#2-Essential-elements-for-a-good-voice-over" class="headerlink" title="2. Essential elements for a good voice over"></a>2. Essential elements for a good voice over</h2><p>You have to ensure that your voice over recording is great from all perspectives. There are certain essential elements that you have to get right in order to make a voice over mediocre to good and even great.</p><p><strong>Audio Clarity</strong></p><p>Every great voiceover has perfect voice quality and comfortable volume. Audiences may find it distracting if the voiceover recording has a muddy and muffled sound. They will definitely miss the important message that you may want to share through the video. Low volume will make people difficult to hear whereas too loud can cause irritation.</p><p>To ensure audio clarity, professionals use voice over recording studio. If you generally record voice over at home, make sure you do it when there is absolute silence in the background. Besides, the mic quality should be top-notch to pick your voice only as close to original and eliminate background noise.</p><p><strong>Pacing of Pitch</strong></p><p>Pacing is the speed of how fast or slow your pitch is. If you go too fast, your audience will not be able to catch you. On the contrary, the slow pace can be boring. It is important to have a natural pace for everyone to understand as well as stay interested. Therefore, maintain a good pace throughout the video but take pauses to add audio effects. Pauses are a part of pacing for allowing the listeners to grab information and for you to breathe properly so that mic does not catch it.</p><p><strong>Vocal Tone</strong></p><p>Vocal tone is about speaking in a pleasant, soothing but natural manner. You need to make sure that the tone has to be engaging but friendly. Sometimes, you may have to fake it but it must not sound fake or boring for the listeners. A proper vocal tone comes with regular practice and experimentation.</p><p><strong>Pronunciation</strong></p><p>Always make sure that you pronounce every word correctly. The listeners must clearly understand what you speak clearly. Avoid mumbling, over-enunciating, and shouting. At times, you may have to avoid your regional accent to make the audience understand with more clarity. Always ask feedback from listeners to be better at pronouncing certain words.</p><h2 id="3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over"><a href="#3-How-To-Record-A-Voice-Over" class="headerlink" title="3. How To Record A Voice Over?"></a>3. How To Record A Voice Over?</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow to record voiceover properly like professionals.</p><p><strong>Getting Ready</strong></p><ul><li>Location: Look for a quiet place to work. Professional voice artists opt for a soundproof room to cancel out external noise. However, you can even go for a quiet area where there is no distracting noise. Microphones can pick up ambient noise that will be reflected in the voiceover recording. Apart from human conversations, you will also have to be careful of the sound coming from electronic gadgets such as computer fans.</li><li>Microphone: Look for a top-notch microphone as per your budget. Consider using a pop filter if you are going to use an external mic. It helps to reduce the distracting sounds with certain alphabets as well as the sound of breathing. Among affordable microphones, you may use modern earbuds or headphones with mic that you use for your smartphone. There are many USB microphones available in the market at an affordable value.</li><li>Voiceover Recorder Software: You need a good-quality audio recording software to record voiceover as well as edit the recording as per requirement. There are many free as well as premium audio recording software available in the market today. We recommend Wondershare Filmora as you can record voice over for any video like professionals as well as edit the recording of audio and video in the same software.</li></ul><p><strong>Writing A Proper Script</strong></p><p>The best way to sound professional during a voice over is to use a proper script. When you don’t use a script, then there can be a lot of pauses and you may try to think about what you will have to say next. When you use a script, you have everything planned out beforehand. Besides, you can also practice what to say when you have a script with pointers and even full explanation of each point. Try to read the script many times and be careful of the words and phrases that can be awkward. Adjust the script accordingly so that it will fit perfectly in the recording.</p><p><strong>Performing A Test Recording</strong></p><p>It is always advisable to go for a test recording to ensure that everything is working properly. In a test recording, you don’t have to go for the entire script but just a few paragraphs. Check if the audio is clear, the volume is at the right level, and the recording is seamless. Check the audio quality by using headphones and not computer speakers.</p><p>**<strong>Microphone Placement</strong> - If you keep the microphone too close to the mouth, there will be all kinds of weird sounds including air puffs. Too far placement will make your voice get fainted. The perfect placement should be about 6 to 8 inches from the mouth and it has to be slightly below the chin. Check the test recording carefully as some microphones can pick up sounds from the table and the computer.</p><p><strong>Recording Voice Over</strong></p><p>So by now, you have the video for which you want to record voiceover.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Balancing-Speed-Quality-Choosing-Between-Lower-and-Higher-FPS"><a href="#Balancing-Speed-Quality-Choosing-Between-Lower-and-Higher-FPS" class="headerlink" title="Balancing Speed &amp; Quality: Choosing Between Lower and Higher FPS"></a>Balancing Speed &amp; Quality: Choosing Between Lower and Higher FPS</h2><p>You probably didn’t anticipate coming across so many technical terms when you first started recording videos. You only wanted to make quality content you know your audience will enjoy. Now you are hearing phrases like frame rate being tossed around, leaving you a bit intimidated.</p><p>After all, you want your videos to be the best they can ever be, don’t you? Plenty of thought and consideration goes into making a high-quality video for YouTube or any other social media platform where your audience will watch it. Therefore, educating yourself and applying the knowledge accordingly would be wise.</p><p>Keep reading this article to learn more about FPS in video recording and how to choose the best frame rate.</p><h2 id="Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording"><a href="#Overview-of-FPS-in-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Overview of FPS in Video Recording"></a>Overview of FPS in Video Recording</h2><p>A video works very similarly to a flipbook, which contains a series of still images. When you view these images at a certain speed, the animation unfolds, giving the illusion that the images are moving. Each image is known as a frame, and the frame rate is the speed at which the frames move. Frame rate is usually expressed as “frames per second,” or FPS in short.</p><p>If a video is set to play at 24fps, it means there are 24 frames in every second the video plays. Technology is very nifty and can trick your brain into the idea that animation flows smoothly. However, if the video were slowed down, you would notice that the motion is not as smooth as it seems. This smooth motion enables you to enjoy the video without hiccups or disruptions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-recording-fps.jpg"                      alt="fps in video recording"                ></p><p>In addition to influencing your audience’s viewing experience, the frame rate also affects how realistic you want your video to be. An FPS of 24 is ideal for movies because the motion is similar to how we see the world.</p><p>On the other hand, sporting events and video games require a higher frame rate to accommodate all the events happening simultaneously. The high frame rate also keeps the details crisp and ensures the motion is as smooth as possible. You wouldn’t want to watch a football match where the motion cuts every three minutes.</p><p>A lower FPS is ideal if you want to blur the video or use techniques like slow motion in the video. You could also opt for a lower FPS if you’re creating animated GIFs. Remember, you can’t make your GIF too large. Therefore, you would rather sacrifice detail and fluid motion and choose a low frame rate with a smaller size.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134244/18498" target="_top" id="2134244">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134244" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134244/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video"><a href="#What-Is-a-Good-FPS-for-Recording-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?"></a>What Is a Good FPS for Recording a Video?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a rule set in stone that will guide you in choosing a frame rate. In fact, there has been a lot of controversy surrounding which frame rate will give your audience the best viewing experience. Research won’t yield the answers you are looking for since there are points to support just about any frame rate you google.</p><p>The simple fact is that different FPS will yield different results, meaning there is no perfect frame rate. The option you choose for your videos will depend on your unique needs and the type of content you want to create. However, there are a few factors you need to consider before you pick the best fps to record video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/factors-for-choosing-recording-video-fps.jpg"                      alt="factors for choosing fps in video recording"                ></p><h4 id="Motion"><a href="#Motion" class="headerlink" title="Motion"></a>Motion</h4><p>If your video contains a lot of movement, it would be wise to stick to a higher frame rate to keep the motion crisp. We also urge you to capture the video at a higher frame rate for increased editing flexibility.</p><h4 id="Realism"><a href="#Realism" class="headerlink" title="Realism"></a>Realism</h4><p>Even though movies are fictitious, the concept should be tied to how we naturally see the world. For instance, when a person throws a ball, we see a bit of blur as the object moves in the air. Therefore, the frame rate you choose should mimic this motion blur and make your video more realistic.</p><h4 id="Delivery"><a href="#Delivery" class="headerlink" title="Delivery"></a>Delivery</h4><p>You can be lax about the frame rate if you want to deliver the video on the Internet because the viewers are a bit forgiving. However, we urge you to stick to 24fps if you project a movie in the theatre to give it a cinematic look. On the other hand, the best frame rate for recording video for TV would be between 24 to 30fps.</p><h3 id="File-size-and-export-time"><a href="#File-size-and-export-time" class="headerlink" title="File size and export time"></a>File size and export time</h3><p>Last but not least, it would be wise to consider the ideal file size for your video and how long it will take to export it. A higher frame rate means more still images are packed into one second of the video. The file size automatically increases, and you will notice that it takes longer to export your videos to platforms like YouTube or Vimeo.</p><h2 id="30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better"><a href="#30-Vs-60-FPS-Video-Recording-–-Which-Is-Better" class="headerlink" title="30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?"></a>30 Vs. 60 FPS Video Recording – Which Is Better?</h2><p>By now, you understand that 30fps means that 30 still images are packed into one second of the video. The same principle applies to 60fps. You will see 30 fps in soap operas, television, and live broadcasts. The shots in this frame rate are more detailed, even though they give the video an unrealistic feel because that isn’t how we naturally view the world.</p><p>On the other hand, 60fps is commonly used in fast-paced videos where you need enough frames to accommodate the action and enjoy the video. However, more filmmakers and directors are incorporating 60 fps in their videos to make the motion look smooth. Have you ever wondered how a slow-motion scene looks so crisp even when the camera zooms in on the actor? A 60-fps frame rate is the answer!</p><p>The debate still continues and people continue to compare 30 vs 60 fps video recording. As we mentioned earlier, there is no ideal fps recording. It all depends on what you want to do with your video.</p><p>For instance, if you want a slow-motion scene with little to no motion blur, then you are better off choosing 60 FPS. You could also choose a higher frame rate when shooting at concerts where a lot is happening at once.</p><p>However, smoothness is not always the best. You are better off sticking to realistic shots for movies or TV shows because that is what day-to-day life looks like. Therefore, 30 FPS is the best choice. An even lower frame rate would work if you want your movie to have a jittery feel or you want to insert a comedic feel into your content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/30-60-fps-video-recording.jpg"                      alt="30 vs 60 fps video recording"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105874/7443" target="_top" id="2105874">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105874" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105874/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording"><a href="#Is-a-Higher-FPS-Better-for-Video-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?"></a>Is a Higher FPS Better for Video Recording?</h2><p>It wouldn’t be a great idea to jump into choosing a high frame rate for your video without understanding what it means or how it will affect the viewing experience.</p><p>Remember, a higher frame rate is not always the best fps for recording video. It might also do more harm than good and leave your video in shambles. You wouldn’t want to go back to the drawing board because you jumped on the bandwagon of choosing a high fps for the sake of it.</p><p>We urge you to do your homework and find out which frame rate works best for the content you want to create. A high fps recording also means your file will be bigger and take longer than usual to export.</p><p>A higher FPS isn’t the ideal choice if you are not willing to deal with a large file size. Another crucial factor to consider would be the viewing experience for your audience.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1902309/19272" target="_top" id="1902309">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1902309" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1902309/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS"><a href="#How-To-Record-Your-Screens-at-Different-FPS" class="headerlink" title="How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?"></a>How To Record Your Screens at Different FPS?</h2><p>Developers have been working tirelessly to create apps to help content creators and filmmakers like yourself record and edit their videos.

It packs powerful features that make screen recording fun, engaging, and convenient. But in this guidepost, we’ll dwell on the little-known <strong>OBS countdown timer</strong>.</p><p>So, what is the OBS Studio countdown timer, and why do you need to make one? This article discusses that and how to add a countdown timer overlay to your local videos using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Let’s dig in!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-OBS-Countdown-Timers" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?"></a>Part 1: What Is OBS Countdown Timers?</h2><p>You probably don’t need a further introduction to a countdown timer if you’re often watching action movies or marking calendars. But clear doubts, a countdown timer is basically the remaining time in years, weeks, days, hours, minutes, or seconds before a start of an event. A good example is those James Bond movies where a bomb has, let’s say, 60 seconds before exploding.</p><p>With that said, you can use the <strong>OBS timer countdown</strong> in multiple ways. For example, you can use it to pump up excitement before a much anticipated live streaming session starts. Remember that OBS Studio supports live streaming to popular platforms like YouTube, Twitch, Facebook, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/obs-countdown-timer-1.jpg"                      alt="obs countdown timer"                ></p><p>So, the timer will tell viewers the duration they’ll have to wait before the next live session. You can even add an action text after the timer ends. A countdown timer can also help you ensure that the viewer sticks around until the end of an event or video.</p><p>Picture this; you can be a fitness trainer on YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, etc. In that case, you’ll need to perform each set of exercises for a specific duration, then rest for like 30 or 60 seconds.</p><p>So, add a timer to the video to guide the trainees throughout the session. This helps make the session more engaging and fun. Whichever the reasons you have to add an <strong>OBS count down timer</strong>, the objective is simple; communicate to the viewers the time left before an event starts or ends.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2006914/19272" target="_top" id="2006914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2006914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2006914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Add-a-Countdown-Timer-in-OBS" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS"></a>Part 2: How To Add a Countdown Timer in OBS</h2><p>Up to this point, you might think that adding an OBS countdown clock is such a complicated task. After all, OBS isn’t the most beginner-friendly screen recorder to use. But don’t fret because adding a countdown timer is one of the most straightforward things to do in OBS Studio. Let’s do that!</p><p>Step1 Fire up OBS Studio and select a recording scene on which you want to apply the countdown timer. Once the scene is ready, tap the Plus button on the Sources section, then select the Text Source. Now give the source a name.

Key Features of SplitCam"></a>2. Key Features of SplitCam</h2><p>Even though it is a completely free video recorder, there are loads of useful features for the users. Here are the key features of SplitCam that you should be aware of.</p><p>Record From Different Sources – You can record webcam video, desktop screen, IP camera, web browser screen, as well as your gameplay. Besides, you can record audio from different sources. In fact, you can record another video, image, PDF document, slideshow, and much more in the background.</p><p>Video Effects – There are loads of video effects available to apply to webcam videos. Besides, there are realistic 3D masks available, and you can replace heads and faces with 3D objects. This will enhance the video content and allow you to create fun videos.</p><p>Live Streaming: With Splitcam, you can live stream to different video services like Justin.tv, UStream, and Livestream instantly. Besides, SplitCam allows you to use webcam with several applications without any issue. You can also upload your video to YouTube instantly.</p><p>Useful Features: The zoom feature is really great for highlighting the needed part. When you are making explanatory video, the zooming feature is a necessity for everyone to focus on the right part. Besides, you can capture screenshots instead of video as well. The software also shows the performance parameters for better understanding.</p><p>HD recording – SplitCam lets you record the desired video from any video source as per the video resolution you need. The software supports up to 2048x1536 video resolution. You can adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpen, and other parameters to enhance the video quality.</p><p>Moreover, you can use hotkeys to operate the software smoothly, and the user interface is quite simple and easy to operate.</p><h2 id="3-In-depth-Review"><a href="#3-In-depth-Review" class="headerlink" title="3. In-depth Review"></a>3. In-depth Review</h2><p>Let us move on to the detailed SplitCam review and analyze how it performs on the parameters that matter the most.</p><p>Performance: SplitCam is not as heavy an application as some of the professional video recorders. Hence, it does not put much pressure on CPU resource. Since the video recording quality is restricted, even at the highest resolution, performance is smooth.</p><p>Video Quality: The video quality is restricted to maximum of 2048x1536 resolution. Therefore, you cannot shoot 4K videos even though your webcam or desktop screen has 4K resolution. Hence, there is a scope for improvement in video quality which is why users look for other SplitCam similar software.</p><p>Support Devices: You can record your external webcam, desktop screen, as well as IP camera. Besides, it supports NDI devices. However, the software is only available for Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p><p>Editing Options: There are different customization options available for adjusting video parameters such as brightness, saturation, and even skin smoother. However, it lacks editing options post-recording so that you could take the video to the next level.</p><h2 id="4-Best-Alternative"><a href="#4-Best-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <updated>2024-09-29T08:40:16.391Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="OBS-Supreme-vs-Streamlabs-Empire"><a href="#OBS-Supreme-vs-Streamlabs-Empire" class="headerlink" title="OBS Supreme vs Streamlabs Empire"></a>OBS Supreme vs Streamlabs Empire</h2><p>When it comes to live streaming on video platforms like YouTube or Twitch from your desktop, you will need a live streaming software. Among live video streaming software, OBS Studio and Streamlabs Desktop clearly stand out. They are popular because they are completely free to use and they have all the necessary features a video streamer desire.</p><p>Not just live streaming on any online platform, they software applications also let you record your live streams, record your computer screen as well as webcam. Now the question arises whether to choose Streamlabs or OBS Studio. We will help you out in your decision making by providing a thorough comparison of OBS vs Streamlabs parameter by parameter.</p><h2 id="1-About-OBS-Studio"><a href="#1-About-OBS-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. About OBS Studio"></a>1. About OBS Studio</h2><p>Here are all the details of OBS Studio that you will help you compare OBS with Streamlabs.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs-pros-and-cons.jpg"                      alt="obs pros and cons"                ></p><p>Performance:</p><p>OBS Studio is designed for multi-tasking. You can live stream as well as record your video. You can capture your screen as well as webcam video simultaneously. In fact, it supports capturing video from various external devices. For regular video recording and streaming, the performance of OBS is top-notch. It does not affect the performance of your streaming or gameplay.</p><p>However, when you have extremely high-quality video playing on your screen or you are playing high-end games that you want to record, OBS Studio tends to consume excessive CPU resources. Therefore, OBS Studio is suitable for regular quality streaming and recording and it might crash if your computer configuration is not top-notch.</p><p>Recording:</p><p>If you are comparing OBS vs Streamlabs for recording, OBS is a clear winner. This is because OBS Studio heavily focuses on recording features while Streamlabs focuses on live streaming broadly. You can record video from any external device, you can modify recording quality, and you can switch between multiple scenes as required. It also comes with filters for color correction, chroma key, and masking for better recording.</p><p>Streaming:</p><p>OBS Studio is the most popular live streaming platform and this is due to its wide compatibility. Once you have Stream URL and Stream key, you can literally stream on any and all online platforms that allow live streaming. Starting from Twitch, YouTube and Facebook to even Instagram and Twitter, you can stream on all popular and not-so-popular platforms directly from your desktop.</p><p>Ease Of Use:</p><p>OBS can be a bit complicated to use for beginners. This is because the user interface is not as clean and intuitive as you would expect. However, once you start using the software for some time, you will get used to the controls and options. But the learning curve is rather steep and that is why many users opt for OBS alternatives. For ease of use, OBS Studio has loads of hotkeys through which you can perform all the different operations instantly.</p><p>Video Quality:</p><p>OBS Studio lets you customize the video quality as per your requirements. You can capture 4K video depending on your screen resolution or camera resolution. However, OBS automatically lowers the frame rate as the resolution of the video goes up which is not desirable. That is why users do not prefer OBS for recording 4K videos and mostly use it for standard, high-definition video quality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918698/19272" target="_top" id="1918698">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918698" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918698/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Pros"><a href="#Pros" class="headerlink" title="Pros"></a>Pros</h3><ul><li>Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.</li><li>Wide range of compatibility for live streaming.</li><li>Customizable settings from different specifications.</li><li>Work with multiple scenes and input sources.</li><li>Pushes latest updates for improved performance.</li></ul><h3 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h3><ul><li>Does not have user-friendly interface.</li><li>Excessive CPU usage and frequent crashes.</li><li>Not very suitable for 4K video quality.</li></ul><h2 id="2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop"><a href="#2-About-Streamlabs-Desktop" class="headerlink" title="2.
